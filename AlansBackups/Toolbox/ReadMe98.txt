This is Toolbox 1.5B3 Beta Aug 2006 for Windows 98.

A beta is a version that is almost ready for release. It should
be almost as reliable as a release. Please report any bugs
or problems you find.

For helpful information, on the Windows Start menu, go to
Programs, Toolbox, Self-Training.

New features since release 1.4 Nov 2004:

Support for Windows native Unicode keyboards. These include 
IM's, IME's, and keyboards built with MSKLC. Previous versions 
could not receive Unicode from native Windows keyboards, 
only from Keyman keyboards. (This does not apply to the
Windows 98 version.)

Mouse works in edit controls (not in Windows 98 version).

Add concordance option to align matched strings if the match
is only part of a word.

Add list of punctuation marks to language encoding. If punctuation
is given, and sort sequence is left blank, sorting will follow standard
code sequence.

Improved XML export of interlinear text. Each word and morpheme
has its annotations immediately after it.

Play sound can play a short segment of a file. If there are numbers
after the file name, these are taken to be the beginning and end of
the segment to play. The numbers are interpreted as seconds, with
three digits after the decimal point.

Improved file compare.

Improved organization of menus and shortcut keys.

Make auto save happen more often in text files.

Rewrite and enlarge self-training package.

New "Start new project" package.
