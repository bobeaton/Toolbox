vBug of paste external Unicode into edit control fail (Dan) 1.4rbd\par
\tab Just produces all question marks\par
\tab So Dan's Unicode keyboard helper doesn't work for that\par
\tab It works in main window, so apparently just something missing\par
\tab This is worth a test update, at least another alpha for Dan\par

xWordlist and Conc write all new base classes\par
\tab Booklist is derived from CStringArray and depends on it\par
\tab CWordList is derived from CMapStringToOb\par
\tab Booklist uses CStringList for one member function\par
\tab StdioFile assumes it is writing UTF16\par
\tab Looks like I need to use fwopen to open UTF16 file names\par
\tab\tab But that implies fgets tries to get wide\par
\tab\tab So, maybe use fread and do my own buffering\par
\tab\tab\tab May not be necessary, but probably is safe and portable\par
\tab\tab\tab If file is opened binary, fread should be pure raw bytes\par
\tab\tab\tab That will let me do exactly the same on Mac as Windows\par
\tab\tab\tab\tab I can do some testing of crlf combos in OS's\par

\tab\tab Loaded corpus contains only refs and data\par
\tab\tab\tab Also contains file names and times\par
\tab\tab CCorpusData is a field list, but not a record\par
\tab\tab Automatically add \\corpusfile to typ, it won't hurt anything\par
\tab\tab\tab Probably can be default language encoding\par
\tab\tab\tab\tab Nothing special based on default will be done with it\par
\tab\tab\tab\tab vConsider whether it being Unicode or not will matter\par
\tab\tab\tab\tab xIf any doubt, make a special language encoding\par
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab Probably not needed, since only for internal use\par

----------------- Mac version notes\par
I tried to use Karen's Mac for reading ebooks as being lighter.\par
But 10.2 doesn't have near as nice of a pfm reader.\par
\tab It doesn't do the fonts nearly as nice.\par
\tab Space doesn't move down.\par
\tab I tried reading with text edit, but it isn't as nice.\par
\tab Fonts not as nice. Space doesn't move down.\par
The older machine doesn't have nearly as nice a keboard.\par
\tab It is a lot stiffer, so not very good for carpal tunnel problems.\par
Battery is still good, holds for almost two hours.\par

\tab Can be handled the same as local buffer\par
vChange all SetDlgItemText with macro 1.4qpv\par
\tab Is it safe to do this change en masse?\par
\tab\tab I think so, I think all CLangEdit have been done\par
\tab\tab If not done yet, they now fail to display, and will do the same\par
xPossibly change all CEdit to CEditLng for port\par
\tab No need, add convrt to UTF16 fixes them fine\par
\tab Uses default language if none assigned\par
vCompare code of CEditLng with CEdit\par
\tab Both use DDX_Control the same\par
\tab CEditLng adds SetEditLngText in OnInitDialog\par
\tab CEditLng adds sGetEditLngText in OnOK\par
\tab CEditLng adds SetLangEnc, but that is optional\par
\tab Both do SetFocus and SetSel\par
\tab Both can use EnableWindow to enable and disable\par
okDirect calls of SetDlgItemText for edit ctrls without mem vars\par
\tab Can change over the same as those with mem vars\par
\tab Example in alan.cpp\par
\tab vNeed to compare with same type of thing with CEditLng\par
\tab\tab Interesting to see how much difference and what they are\par
\tab For some reason, alan.cpp doesn't have any membr vars\par
\tab I guess the standard data exchange is doing it\par
\tab To change to member var\par
\tab\tab Add member var in class derived from CDialog\par
\tab\tab Add DDX_Control in DoDataExchange\par
\tab\tab\tab Add DoDataExchange if necessary\par
\tab\tab Add SetEditLngText in OnInitDialog\par
\tab\tab Add sGetEditLngText in OnOK\par
\tab\tab No need for SetFocus, SetSel, etc\par
\tab vMaybe no problem with no member var, seems ok\par
\tab\tab If the value is directly set and picked up\par
\tab okIs the CEdit member var redundant? yes, but ok to leave\par
\tab\tab vCheck to see if it actually makes any differenc\par
\tab\tab\tab It probably was used by data exchange\par
\tab\tab\tab But direct set and get from cntrl bypass the member var\par
\tab\tab\tab Presumably member var is only needed if some override\par
\tab\tab\tab But standard CEdit member var has no overrides\par
\tab\tab Probably simplest and safest is to leave it alone\par
\tab\tab No obvious benefit from changing it at this time\par
\tab\tab All this goes away soon on the port anyway\par
xTry using SetWindowTextA for SetWindowText\par
\tab Not for edit controls, but for window titles and statics\par
\tab As I do that for a function, make careful not for testing later\par
\tab This is a technique to get to compile\par
\tab If it fails to display correctly, then backup plan is to convrt data\par
\tab Almost surely will show garbage\par
\tab Much safer to convert to UTF16 and keep SetWindowText\par
\tab vMake UTF16 convert that depends on Unicode switch\par
\tab\tab That saves a lot of conditionals in the main code\par
1.4qpu Fix WinExecWait for Unicode\par
vMake CString swUTF16( wxStr8 sUTF8 ) and vice versa 1.4qpt\par
\tab These are perfectly safe for non-language data\par
\tab File names and such things can safely convert that way\par
\tab Easier and more likely to work correctly than other ways\par
vBug of wrap messing up end of interlinear line 1.4qps\par
\tab Causes problem for Karen's convert Austin Unicode\par
\tab I need to detect the situation where\par
\tab\tab 1. I am past the break width \par
\tab\tab 2. There is only one word in the line\par
\tab\tab 3. I am at the end of the line\par
\tab I come out of the do loop knowing I am past break width\par
\tab Worth fixing, but won't be used in Austin Unicode convrt\par
\tab If I were to take a guess at it, what would my best guess be?\par
vToday's project is to make an error classifying system\par
\tab vCopy the error messages to a file\par

\tab vConsider frequency as part of deciding what to do next\par
\tab\tab Reducing frequent ones will make the job more tenable\par
\tab\tab Also it will reduce the compile time as more files are clean\par
xMaybe DDX_Control is no longer necessary for CEditLng\par
\tab vExperiment to see if conc search works without it\par
\tab\tab It is no longer necessary to set or get window text\par
\tab\tab OnPaint does the paint from member var\par

\tab But I don't have a function to convert to unsigned short\par
\tab I have one to convert a single char to long UTF32\par
\tab But that doesn't produce an array, and it isn't short\par
\tab Maybe I could mask it to short somehow?\par
\tab Maybe I can make my own message box that shows UTF8\par

Should programming be fun? It often is. Why isn't it? Because of pressures and bad emotions. How can I make it fun? By relaxing and accepting the reality of the general life situation. The problem is that Toolbox is a ten year old source in a changing world, and it is in use by hundreds of people, and there are oodles of things that can or should be done to it, and it is a lot of work to do some of them. But still it is all coding, and I should be able to enjoy the activity. I have forgotten that. There is the joy of discovery and detail work, and the joy of seeing things work successfully.\par

I've mislaid the attitude that says slow and careful is good.\par
\tab I need to find it back.\par

\tab I am generally in good health.\par
\tab Slow and careful seems to get results here just fine.\par
\tab I have various optional choices available.\par
\tab All deadlines are artificial.\par
\tab For example, release 1.5 by SAG conference is artificial.\par
\tab\tab SAG conf is not much for computer upgrades.\par
\tab\tab Most of 1.5 is not for SAG people.\par
\tab But I might make 1.5 just fine.\par
Can I make it to 1.5 by SAG conf?\par
\tab I need good estimates on the critical things.\par
\tab I need to sort things into optionals.\par
\tab Five weeks left, minus a week or so consulting.\par
I think my real problem is deadline mortis. \par
\tab I want more in 1.5 than fits by SAG conference.\par
I also have chooser mortis.\par
\tab I want more new features than fit with port.\par
The last few months I have closure failure.\par
\tab Yanked from unclosed top-down port to IME.\par
\tab Yanked from unclosed IME to TDF and 1.5 release.\par
\tab Port in general stays very unclosed for a long time.\par

At JNU: This is exciting! It looks like if we had hand picked a place for service to the linguistic community, we could not have done better. Anvita is an active user with two more years on her project. She is on a SOAS grant for endangered languages. She is an expert on field linguistics, with long experience in doing it, and Toolbox is designed as a tool for that kind of linguist. She says data collection and descriptive presentation is growing in importance again in linguistics. South Asia is one of the most interesting and exciting places for fieldwork. Living in South Asia looks like the right kind of place for doing this kind of work. The Lord has obviously done a good thing here, and this looks like a big push toward the linguistic community support.\par
How much word would it take to get true structured XML on an export of interlinear? Some, but not a lot. It would have to work down each bundle, and collect the pieces. Presumably the collection of morpheme pieces would be nested under the word pieces. But the official annotation does not have space separated pieces under the words. It has whole chunks under the words, with matching hyphens to separate the pieces. That form would be a lot easier to output as XML. But it is a subset of the broader form, so it might be worth implementing the broader form if it isn't too complicated.\par
What I really need is direct contact with a knowledgable SOAS rep who can tell me what is the best layout and form. Anvita doesn't know that, and the information she has is not very clear on it. After I have that contact and information, then I can work on a package to do it as smoothly as possible, and I can have Anvita as a tester.\par
So for the moment I need to work on opening the SOAS contact(s) and getting the information about what would be most effective.\par

I need to calm down about progress and schedule.\par
I had a message from Steve White asking if Mac was coming end of this year, and it made me think about such things.\par
What happened to port?\par
I started in Nov last year. Then came Dec & Jan in US, which turned out less worktime than I had hoped. I started on wxWidgets sample app in NC in Jan, and spent Feb on it. Then came the note from Steve about Dan and the IME, which is the big thing that really blew away the port. I could not let them do a parallel version, not for something as far-reaching as IME support. It would have been almost impossible to fit it back together. In actuality, they never appeared to necessarily have the people to do the IME work, but the possibility was there. Anyway, I dove into IME in March & Apr, and made some good progress. But I also let myself do what added up to a month of consulting in Ktm, and then came the second US trip. At that point, TDF looked high priority, so it was done, even before further IME work, and that led to the plan of a release before the IME. There really are lots of things ready to go in this version. But because of the port being way past when I had hoped, and now  the IME also way past when I had hoped, I have a tendency to feel bad rather than good about Toolbox. The root problem is that both port and IME are not really my strong point, and I have had a hard time getting into them and making good progress, and it has been easy to let other things come in instead. But at the same time, I feel guilty as the proposed deadlines slide on and on.\par
How can I feel happier?\par
I have notified people of the new proposed deadlines, and no one is making major objections or insisting on bringing in people to help me. I suppose having others brought in is the biggest fear I have right now. I know from past experience that when number two comes in, they work rapidly without much worry about compatibility and consistency and not breaking things. They feel good because they do a lot of coding. I do less coding because I have to spend a lot of time explaining and working with them. And when they are done, I have to do a lot of follow-up coding to fix all the messes they have left. So, the end result is that whatever they are working on gets all the coding time, both from them and from me. I have found years ago already that I am better off just doing it myself. But that means I have to head off the efforts of others to come in and "help".\par
Thankfully, at the moment, no one is trying to come in and help, and no priority is pushing such that they would. The IME appears to be accepting the current schedule, plus that the temporary workaround is keeping some of them going for now. The port to Mac could draw a programmer, but that community doesn't seem to have enough resources to offer such. So, I think there is reasonable hope that I will be allowed to do it in my own way, and at my own speed. Karen may be going to help with the dialog boxes, and that might be good. On the other hand, she could help with documentation or other things, and that might be as good or better. On the other hand, she doesn't know as much about some things, so I will have to draft some anyway. Plus, she is not actually being very productive these days, beyond answering eml questions. She has a long way to go on TDF.\par
So, I need to thank the Lord for the current situation, and accept it, and use what wisdom I have to do my best. I have all of Sept and part of Oct to prepare a release. Other than the punc stuff I am doing right now, everything else is pretty optional whether it gets in this release or not. On the other hand, the list of things I hope for are really valuable things that will be great to have for users. So, what I need to do is prepare a reasonable release to put on LSB, and then keep working away, expecting more releases in the coming year.\par
Maybe one way to ask the question is: Am I feeling uncomfortable because I am doing the wrong thing in any way? Should I do something different? If I should do anything different, then I should figure that out, and change. If I should continue as is, then I should be happy about it, and I should work as quickly and effectively as I can.\par
I do feel a bit uncomfortable about my amount of work in a day and my rate of progress. I am making some good improvements by going to be earlier and expanding the morning. I also have been able to do some work in the afternoon recently, so maybe there is progress on that front.\par
I think the cold and the other leftover wearinesses from jet-lag and tiredness from all the travel have slowed me down and discouraged me. Also, as described above, the fact that so many things have come up in the past year has a tendency to leave me feeling insecure about the future. It is perfectly true that I don't know the future, and things could come up. On the other hand, last years things were pretty well anticipated in many ways, so it wasn't that they were sudden, drastic surprises. So, the best is to face the future with hope and confidence, trusting the Lord to handle the unexpected.\par
I have definitely been a bit depressed in various ways, and that is surely the worst of my problem at the moment. That is specifically what I am addressing this morning. Hopefully, recovery from the cold, time to recover from jet-lag and travel weariness, and time to get settled again will take care of most of the depression. Also, reducing the guilt from past missed deadlines will help. It will go as I convince myself that people understand that I had good reasons for delays, and so they are not upset at me about it. If I had done something bad, that would be one thing. But since it was external things, that is another thing.\par
So, rejoice in the Lord, be happy, enjoy the life God has provided, and work with energy and enthusiasm! Look forward to seeing Toolbox continue to do good things for people, and do my best to make them happen.\par

Where am I?\par
I have done a lot this week on Linux Wine, and it is mostly working. It needs just a bit more debugging and documenting and preparation, and I can make it a test version at the same time as I make the other test version. \par
_Linux Wine test version 1da\par
On Tamil, I quit typing because I was making progress on the code conversion. I could either download the rest and do code conversion on all of it, or I could work on getting Mat into standard referenced format. It is tempting to think that I would really have something if I had the whole corpus to play with. But on the other hand, Mat is a sufficient corpus to do a lot, and might be good for a start. I think I should get started with that, and then see about the rest. I might even want to put the whole thing in one file, or maybe not, since that would make the update interlinear a little too slow to do reasonably on the whole thing. Probably it stays multiple files, maybe combine some of the smaller books.\par

On Tbx release prep, there are a half dozen things I want in yet, about 2 weeks yet. I can do a couple of test versions before then. I want to get in a few things fairly quickly so they will be in the next test version.\par

I feel a bit beat up today. I worked well yesterday, but last evening was rough. Eddie and Jenny came for a couple of hours, then the end of the Sri Lanka cricket final took till close to 11:00, and I was in bed after 11:00. So that's why. Too much E, and not sleeping quite the right hours. Given another hour to wake up, I will probably be fine. I need breakfast and my second tea.\par
But the good news is that yesterday was the best day since we came back. I worked extra long in the morning, and I worked a couple of sessions in the afternoon. I felt encouraged that the source is in shape to put out test versions. I think it will go well.\par
Aug 4 Th\par
How committed am I to the edit control revision?\par
I started it on a whim last night, and I was surprised and pleased that it appeared to be a lot easier than I thought. This is all to the good. I got all encouraged and acted as though I would go through with it and use it in the upcoming test version. However, I am not sure if I am committed enough to that to do it.\par
The root question is how long I want to delay the test version. I was ready to go with it except for the display of Unicode in the Find edit control. I don't know why that is failing, and I don't know how long it has failed. I need to look back and diagnose it. But one solution was the thorough cleanup and rework I looked at yesterday. I started by considering whether I could use one edit control everywhere. Then I went on to consider whether I could clean up that edit control. And I went on to try cleaning it up.\par
That is a good thing and is worth doing. But it probably implies a week or more of work, which would be further delay on the test version for Roland. Maybe I should do the test version with the bug in it, and then work on the dialog box more slowly and carefully.\par
Another question is whether this test version will be for Roland only, or whether it will be for others.\par
Another question is how this relates to TDF and the release. I don't want to delay work on TDF for too long. And I don't want the release to have too fresh of rework of dialog box code. On the other hand, if the dialog box cleanup works well, that could strengthen the release. And it is a step toward the IME, which could help that finish sooner. So I think it is probably worth doing.\par
Maybe I should roll back the dialog box work temporarily, do a test version for Roland, and then bring it back in.\par
Lord, give me wisdom on this!\par
I should check out when the find box quit displaying Unicode. That might give me a clue on how to do a simple fix that would get that bug taken care of for this test version.\par
I think most of my backups are on Karen, but a couple got put on the Mac. They should be moved to Karen as well.\par
Aug 2, Tue\par
I have been reading in the UTC library for 2 days, and I was reading a book about mental efficiency and concentration. It made me think about some of the problems I have in getting to work on Toolbox.\par
I think the worst is the overwhelming nature of the short deadline on the port. I need to tell myself that if the port takes longer, nothing bad will happen. In fact, the current delay on the port resulted in the Mac community buying me a new, fast, expensive Mac. So there won't necessarily be any bad results. I don't even need to say anything to the committee about it until sometime next year. My most recent message has now given me lots of leeway. If next summer or fall it is apparent that I won't make it by the end of the year, then I can talk to the committee about it again. But at the moment, I got no particular reactions from them to my message giving the reasons for delays so far.\par
The book on mental efficiency talked about reasons for distraction:\par
\tab 1. The way is unknown.\par
\tab 2. The way is blocked.\par
\tab 3. The way is boring or unpleasant.\par
\tab 4. The way offers no rest.\par
All of these have some truth for the port and IME, but especially three and four seem to apply.\par
I have been pushing away a variety of enhancements that could motivate me in favor of the port for over a year now, but the port has not moved much either. The result is that I feel discouraged, like I don't know how long it will actually take, and  like I don't know how long it might be before I can actually get back to more fun types of coding.\par
I think I probably need to open up to some of the little enhancements along the way and stop feeling that the port takes precedence over all the things I would like to do.\par
It is true that the port seems in some ways boring or unpleasant, but in fact, it won't be that bad most of the way. And if I do some other things along the way, then it won't be bad at all.\par
One thing I can do right now is to make test versions more personalized. Instead of thinking that a test version is for the whole tester list, I could announce it only to the subset who actually have a stake in it. Test versions for the whole tester list would be ones that are closer to release and that are supposed to be quite debugged, and that really need thorough testing. That way I can let the stakeholders of a particular new feature have it early, but it won't matter so much if there are a few known bugs outstanding in the test version they use.\par
On the other hand, I see quite a few stakeholders in the bugs I fixed since the last test version, so maybe a few more days is worth waiting. I will pray about it.\par
Lord, help me to have wisdom, and to have motivation on all of these things. You know that I like closure and would like to put out a test version and then be able to relax a little and do some clean-up. On the other hand, I hate to see Roland Fumey wait so long, so I want to get something to him very soon. I did notify him that I am working on it, so maybe another couple of days is all right.\par
Other good thoughts from the book on mental efficiency:\par
4 Factors in mental efficiency:\par
1. Intellectual: Attention, Reflection, Retention\par
2. Affective: Feelings, Emotions\par
3. Volitive: Motivation, Decision\par
4. Organic: Muscles, Blood, Respiration\par
Concentration is the main factor in efficiency and happiness.\par
Make haste slowly! Better because fewer repetitions.\par
Ideal = Emotion = Enthusiasm\par
Concentration = Efficiency = Joy\par
3 Stages in concentration\par
1. Adjustment: Preparation\par
2. Absorption\par
3. Saturation: Weakening\par

2005 Jan \par
Am I overcommitted?\par
Or are my estimates not reachable?\par
This two month break has slid some of them down a little.\par
And some of them may have been unrealistic.\par
If Mac takes past the end of 2005, that is all right.\par
Toolbox has had plenty of releases, and will have another before long, so it certainly doesn't look like it is standing still.\par
\par

I think it is not time to say anything to the committee yet.\par
This trip has made some delay.\par
But I see my estimates were a bit off, even without this trip.\par
Christmas vacation time, plus retreat would have eaten 4-6wks.\par
So this trip really only added a month.\par
TDF is a big thing that has added two months.\par
General stuff in Oct-Nov added a month or so.\par
Port to wxWindows still looks about the same.\par
So, adding 4 mo pushes Mac port to end of 2005.\par

What does PACE say?\par
\pard\fi-288\li720\tx288\tx576\tx864\tx1152\tx1440\tx1728\tx2016\tx2304\tx2592 How many hours is a day? What about things like getting train tickets and doing income tax? How do they fit in? I can either pad the hours enough that 8 of them fit into day, or I can trim the day down to something more like actual hours available at the computer. What with limitations on sciatic and eyes and so on, PACE may say I can't realistically be at the computer more than 5 or 6 hours per day. Even that is a lot. 5 hours actually sitting at computer is probably a good, realistic PACE number. But that stretches a lot because I need short and long breaks mixed into it a lot. So it seems like I was at the computer more hours than that. A day at the computer has to include a variety of breaks for reading, moving around, etc.\par
Frankly, it is easier to estimate in terms of actual hours. I know how long a job takes in continuous work. But I don't know how to lengthen the estimate to allow for overhead. Plus, if I do lengthen it, it feels false, somehow, because it doesn't really take that long. So, the best is to do real estimates, but use 5 hours per day as the amount of real hours that fit into a day. That way, I can truly say that job x took 2 hours, but know that before, during, and after the 2 hours I took a total of an hour or so of break, which was necessary and normal.\par
\pard\tx288\tx576\tx864\tx1152\tx1440\tx1728\tx2016\tx2304\tx2592 Thinkng about the feeling of pressure:\par
\pard\fi-288\li720\tx288\tx576\tx864\tx1152\tx1440\tx1728\tx2016\tx2304\tx2592 I realized that I was saying to myself that I would try to find time for income tax and such things when I got time. But with the wxWindows port and all the other work hanging over my head, I felt like I will never really get time. So I have to take a different approach.\par
I decided that there are only two ways I could fail to accomplish the port (and the other major goals work the same way). 1. The committee and I could decide to put my time to something else instead. In that case, I would be happy about it because the something else would be something more wanted and making a more significant difference to SAG. 2. I might for health or other reasons be unable to do the work. In that case, I wouldn't care because if I can't, then I can't.\par
But one way of becoming unable to do the work is to push too hard now, and in some way hurt my physical or mental health.\par
Another doubt I feel is what happens if I am too slow on these projects? Two possible results:\par
\tab\tab 1. I finish later than I and others could wish, but people still put the result to good use for a few years.\par
\tab\tab 2. I miss the window of opportunity before something else comes available and popular for doing the job. In that case, the window was probably short enough that I was better of not doing the work anyway. And these things are not instant surprises. They take time to become popular. And at the moment there are no serious alternatives on the horizon for the Mac and Linux people. And there are not serious alternatives very near yet for the general features of Toolbox. And for Scripture there are no serious alternatives yet inside SAG. If the new Scripture editor comes out and gets into use in SAG, then it will spare us from having to go to Nasik to teach Toolbox. And it will spare me from having to support the Scripture uses of Toolbox.\par
But I suspect it will be years before the Scripture editor gets into very wide use in SAG.\par
\tab\tab 1. It probably won't run on W98, Mac, Linux. W98 will continue to have a lot of users worldwide. Paratext 6 has the same problem. It may be that soon Toolbox will be the only supported package for W98 Scripture editing. And the same will be true for Mac and Linux.\par
\tab\tab 2. Inertia is hard to overcome. Many of the people settled into Toolbox will continue to use it simply because it is hard to get them converted over.\par
\tab\tab 3. What extra features can Scripture editor have that would attract an ordinary user to want to change? Not much.\par
So, the end result is that I need to convince myself that I need to PACE myself. I need to work at a sustainable rate that can be maintained for years. It is better to work a little too slow than a little too fast. If I work too fast, I will have crashing periods of time that will bring down the average. If I work a little too slow, it may come out about the same, and I will have better health and presumably will have fit a little extra fun and enjoyment into the extra time. That will lead to better creative thinkng and better efficiency in the time I do work.\par

How do I figure this out?\par
\tab Try to remember and/or record every gift.\par
\tab Sum the gross totals from the reports.\par
Oct started at -710. Every month auto is -230 auto.\par
Also, we did -60 3 or 4 months in Bangalore, plus odds and ends.\par
Also, 40% of conference travel (-600) was donation to group. It gave them\par
more money for NNLPI and other projects. Officially our 750 each travel\par
per year is considered donation to group as well. I don't think we count that.\par
It isn't really voluntary, whereas the conf trvl was voluntary and intentional.\par
I think I should just forget the travel.\par
\tab I don't have records enough to count it.\par
\tab I am not really motivated by giving, more by laziness, not wanting the\par
\tab hassle of calculating it in detail and submitting receipts and reports for it.\par
Tith of rent? Probably should, it really is income.\par
\tab Taxes and insurance are about 300 per year, 25 per month.\par
\tab Power probably averages 75 or so. so it plus taxes is 100, leaving 300 income.\par
\tab Other actual expenses can be deducted when they happen.\par

This is a discussion area for me when I want to make lists, etc.\par
7-10-01 SAG Field Linguist's Toolbox\par
Install notes:\par
To run it again, run from Start menu, then double click the project.\par
I need to use the Wizard to start fresh with the full name Field Ling\'85\par
I can remove the warning about uninstalling. I see where it comes from.\par
I need to figure out where it gets the SAG in Program Files\\SAG\\Toolbox.\par
I need to reword the copyright warning. That will also be the intro notes.\par
I need to get rid of the splash screen, or do something about it.\par
I can associate .prj files. It takes a bit of code, but there is a sample.\par
Neat ideas:\par
_Do Sentrans style disambiguation during parse and lookup combination. Do every word of sentence that is unambiguous, then try ambiguous ones again with rules until no more appear. Then do hand disambig of any remaining ones.\par
_Add a Hand Revise adaptation interlinear process that makes a copy of previous if it doesn\rquote t exist, but is left alone if it does exist. It can be used like Brian Bull was doing to make the revised output, and to be a target for improving the formulas.\par
_Write up how to do morpheme classes and properties in analysis and in synthesis. Consider if it needs some more power to do it well, and how to add that.\par
_Think of it as a market share competition with the alternatives. Go for it in feature set and in advertising. Laugh when it has a big market share! Be fearless in adding features and making it available. Find ways of making it available for download from non-SIL web sites.\par
_Do English analysis to make a base for auto-gloss.\par

Then trim off differences and propose rest as root. Also do root guess based on possible affixes to see if it gets down to a root. Also see if affixes or words in analyzed English give clues to meanings of affixes that are not in dictionary yet.\par
Start on verify.\par
For verify, keep ambigs instead of asking user, and\par
\tab disambig based on what is already there\par
vI need to see what happens with ambigs, and where.\par
How in the world am I going to do forced glosses?\par
I could maybe work forward through the processes and\par
\tab verify each one going down as far as necessary.\par
I could maybe use some kind of recursion or loop\par
\tab to work each ambig forward through the existing code\par
\tab until it either\tab succeeds or fails.\par
This might be\par
\tab necessary because the other fails to do everything\par
\tab the existing code does, like punc, cap, etc.\par
This implies encapsulating a chunk of the existing code,\par
\tab or at least it would be a lot easier if the\par
\tab existing code were encapsulated better. Actually,\par
\tab the code desparately needs to be encapsulated because\par
\tab the routine has gotten way too long.\par
Two choices:\par
1. Try to minimize the effort by doing shortcuts.\par
2. Do it thoroughly, however much effort it takes.\par
SAG has already approved 4 months, and I can do it\par
\tab very thoroughly in that time. On the other hand,\par
\tab I can do it a lot quicker if I do it less\par
\tab thoroughly. I may even be able to do it a lot\par
\tab quicker just by working more hours than I was\par
\tab expecting. I also need to allow for times when\par
\tab trips and Paul visit and PD travel and library\par
\tab and BibleTrans testing here etc. will\par
\tab take time away. So my impression that I can\par
\tab put in a lot of time this week is one I need\par
\tab to be careful of. Reality is that long-term I\par
\tab can't average much more than I can average. So the \par
\tab best attitude is just to keep my long public estimates\par
\tab as they are, and don't get too ambitious on my\par
\tab private estimates either.\par
8-1-01\par
I did some modularizing of th interlinear code, so th main\par
\tab routine is a lot shorter. This is in preparation for\par
\tab possibly making a separate verify routine tht will use\par
\tab a lot of the interlinear code.\par
8-10-01\par
I installed v4 & cross compilers & changed title & \par
\tab about to Toolbox.\par

N represents the Unicode character value expressed as a decimal number.  This keyword is followed immediately by equivalent character(s) in ANSI representation. In this way, old readers will ignore the \\uN keyword and pick up the ANSI representation properly. When this keyword is encountered, the reader should ignore the next N characters, where N corresponds to the last \\ucN value encountered. As with all RTF keywords, a keyword-terminating space may be present (before the ANSI characters) that is not counted in the characters to skip. While this is not likely to occur (or recommended), a \\bin keyword, its argument, and the binary data that follows are considered one character for skipping purposes. If an RTF scope delimiter character (that is, an opening or closing brace) is encountered while scanning skippable data, the skippable data is considered to be ended before the delimiter. This makes it possible for a reader to perform some rudimentary error recovery. To include an RTF delimiter in skippable data, it must be represented using the appropriate control symbol (that is, escaped with a backslash,) as in plain text. Any RTF control word or symbol is considered a single character for the purposes of counting skippable characters. An RTF writer, when it encounters a Unicode character with no corresponding ANSI character, should output \\uN followed by the best ANSI representation it can manage. Also, if the Unicode character translates into an ANSI character stream with count of bytes differing from the current Unicode Character Byte Count, it should emit the \\ucN keyword prior to the \\uN keyword to notify the reader of the change. RTF control words generally accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments. For this reason, Unicode values greater than 32767 must be expressed as negative numbers.\cell\row\trowd\trgaph75\trleft-75\trbrdrl\brdrs\brdrw20 \trbrdrt\brdrs\brdrw20 \trpaddl75\trpaddr75\trpaddfl3\trpaddfr3

This keyword may be used at any time, and values are scoped like character properties. That is, a \\ucN keyword applies only to text following the keyword, and within the same (or deeper) nested braces. On exiting the group, the previous \\uc value is restored. The reader must keep a stack of counts seen and use the most recent one to skip the appropriate number of characters when it encounters a \\uN keyword. When leaving an RTF group that specified a \\uc value, the reader must revert to the previous value. A default of 1 should be assumed, if no \\uc keyword has been seen in the current or outer scopes.  A common practice is to emit no ANSI representation for Unicode characters within a Unicode destination context (that is, inside a \\ud destination.). Typically, the destination will contain a \\uc0 control sequence. There is no need to reset the count on leaving the \\ud destination as the scoping rules will ensure the previous value is restored.\cell\row\pard\tx288\tx576\tx864\tx1152\tx1440\tx1728\tx2016\tx2304\tx2592\cf0\par

I have cleared the decks with Alice, and am now supposed\par

\tab here. I don't know if that can really mean 4 hr/da.\par
I installed Keyman and the Dev keyboard, and verified\par
\tab that I have the Code2000 font installed, and it all\par
\tab works fine.\par
I made a test to see that my WordPad does the render\par
\tab and produces Unicode just like the one at Horsleys Green.\par
I can't get Word to output it as UTF-8, but I may be\par
\tab missing some trick, or it might be different. It doesn't\par
\tab really matter, I can use WordPad. And I have a UTF-8\par
\tab sample file from HG. I may start a different direction\par
\tab anyway.\par
I also looked at Rich Edit Control a bit, but I am\par
\tab not sure that is a helpful way to start.\par
I might want to start by seeing what it takes to input\par
\tab 16-bit values from Keyman.\par
Or I might want to start by adding Unicode to .lng.\par
\tab Unicode keyboard input could be conditioned on that.\par
The whole question of how a language or a file or\par
\tab whatever is identified as Unicode is an important one.\par
I just tested and found that existing Tbx inputs\par
\tab English even if Dev keyboard is turned on. There\par
\tab must be some way of getting at the Unicode input\par
\tab value that is different. I need to study helps and\par
\tab see if I can find that out.\par
I just pasted a bit of UTF-8 text into a Tbx database.\par

\tab and now I can try making it display if I want\par
\tab to start that way.\par

\tab They seem to come from parsing the Annapurna Devnagri.\par
Tricky! It shows 3 ambigs, but does not output the one I choose. It outputs the only one that matches the formulas! Weird!\par
I am working with a simplified set of word formulas in db type 2 & file 2.\par
I see now that parse is working fine. The problem is that the next lookup doesn't make use of the forced gloss from parse, so it asks for ambiguity. That is also why the ambig box has formulas grey.\par
But still something strange happens in that after I pick one, it doesn't use it. It may come from the same problem as mae. It is at least worth playing with that and the fastlook a bit before I chase this one much further.\par
Changing to plain CSet from CFastSet doesn't help.\par
Do I dig into this bug more now? Or do I work on Unicode? Somehow Unicode seems more critical, although I do hope to get back to this bug someday, as you never know when it will bite somebody. I should at least enter it into the database.\par
I see that another way of addressing this bug is that attempting to jump to mae doesn't work because it doesn't select the word. When I select the word first, it jumps fine. So I may have a much more direct path to the bug in that jump word selection code.\par
It seems to be down in BMChar, but seems to come from a set element already set wrong.\par
The trouble is this isn't getting Unicode. I think it is time to go back to that, and maybe I will hit this one again later.\par
vI am interested in working on a CC to convert Annapurna to Unicode. It would be nice if somebody else made it, but it looks like that may not be happening. Ideally I would like to see each code in its font, so something like a two-line Shoebox file might work well. Would space delimited work? Might be a mess to convert, so probably better is just pairs of lines.\par

Summarize how to do a control:\par
Put it on the dialog box.\par
How does a control in a dialog box get connected to a class?\par
\tab Ans: By the class of its member variable.\par
\tab It shows up as a member variable in the afx section.\par
\tab I made a class derived from CListBox.\par
\tab When I added a member var with ClassWiz, it allowed me to make\par
\tab\tab it one of my derived class instead of the base class!\par
\tab\tab I guess I could also have changed it afterward as well. It warned me\par
\tab\tab to make sure I had the definition of the control available to the \par
\tab\tab dialog in the alan.h file.\par
\tab I see that Shw tends to put those member variables outside the afx.\par
\tab\tab That fooled me some because I couldn't see in ClassWiz\par
\tab\tab\tab that they had any member vars at all.\par
It looks like I may be trying again with the infamous OnPaint.\par
\tab That really seems to be the right way. I don't know why it\par
\tab\tab seemed to make things so slow the last time. Maybe it\par
\tab\tab only slows down in debugging or some such.\par
\tab Another convenience is the CPaintDC object that nicely\par
\tab\tab takes care of BeginPaint and EndPaint.\par
\tab I found that putting SetFont in OnPaint caused it to call itself \par
\tab\tab over and over. That sort of thing might have been the cause\par
\tab\tab of the slowdown. It seems fine now.\par
I have it working now through select all or not, delete selection,\par
\tab\tab Unicode input, backspace deletes whole Unicode char.\par
vAllow paste\par
CEditLng control is quite usable without a cursor and mouse click.\par
\tab It shows the initial value selected\par
\tab It deletes initial value if the user starts typing or presses backspace.\par
\tab It accepts keyman input and shows Unicode.\par
\tab It deletes back on backspace, including correct for Unicode.\par
\tab It accepts paste.\par
\tab Paste replaces any selected.\par
\tab Paste goes after any unselected.\par
xAllow cursor editing in control. I decided against this for now because\par
\tab my efforts to get the cursor to show didn't do any good. ShowCaret()\par
\tab doesn't cause anything to show, even when called OnPaint after the text\par
\tab is written, and with the position set to something above zero. So my\par
\tab conclusion is that it isn't worth the effort for now, and I should just\par
\tab use the control as is for a long time. I doubt it will cause much\par
\tab complaint even if it is this way in the release. It is no loss of functionality,\par
\tab just a slight loss of visibility. It will be interesting to see if the find and\par

On correction for dictionary change: I will have a dictionary entry that is changed, presumably the to stuff, although I suppose once in awhile the from stuff will be respelled. If the from stuff is respelled, there isn't much I can do, because I can't fix the places where the parse will now fail that it used to succeed. Or maybe I can? I suppose if it is the underlying form that has changed, then I could go through and substitute all those places, confident that the lookup of the new underlying form would still produce the same lookup output.\par
So, how do I find these places? Imagine I have just changed the gloss of \ldblquote able\rdblquote  to \ldblquote can\rdblquote . I think I want to find every place where \ldblquote able\rdblquote  is a gloss from the current lexeme and fix it. The alternative is to find every place where \ldblquote able\rdblquote  is looked up, and apply the lookup that produces the gloss and see if this one has the old gloss. If it does, then substitute the new gloss. That is the original algorithm I was thinkng of, before I started thinkng I could find every place where the old gloss was output and go back and reapply the lookup from the input line. In either case, I want to be able to apply a specific lookup to a specific input and get the answer for a specific output. In other words, I want to apply the lookup that produced the modified output (the gloss), and check on its output. I guess in either case, I need to identify both the from and the to lines for the lookup. There is no free lunch possible. If I identify the correct process, I will be checking the right thing. The correct process is obviously the one whose output is the modified output, not the first lookup on the input. So I do need to change the way I do that.\par

_Keyman force doesn\rquote t look like it is going to work. It turns out that in order to mix languages in a field, one has to change keyboards to get the other language.

On the HindiNT, I decided to try to do two databases. One with Annapurna and Romanization, (and maybe Unicode), another that is just the Annapurna run through CC to Unicode. I will try to work with that one mostly, but the Romanization will be available by the focus jump, so I can see it when I want. But it will not be immediately readable, so I will be less inclined to lean on it as I go along.\par
I am thinkng that what I want to do for gloss guess is to ask it what is the most likely equivalent either way. Either starting with a Hindi word, ask for best English, or starting with an English root, ask for best Hindi. In either case, it will be just a best match between the word list entries. I am thinking to work from word lists of 100 refs.\par

When I press Ctrl-N and bring up the Insert Record dialogue box in the lexicon, if I am not in the \\lx or other vernacular field, then the vernacular keyboard is not activated. But since the point of the box is to provide the string that goes in the \\lx field, it should automatically activate the language and language properts of the \\lx field. If I am in the \\lx field when I open the Insert Record dialogue box, then the text box is already filled out with the string in the \\lx field of the current record. It is a small matter to have to delete this each time, but I assume this is not a desired feature. Nevertheless, if I was in another database or another program, using another keyboard, then when I return to the Toolbox lexicon and press Ctrl-N, the vernacular keyboard is not activated, even though the cursor in the lexicon is in the \\lx field. I have to return to the lexicon, click in non-vernacular field, then click again in a vernacular field. Only then does the Insert Record box allow me to enter text using the vernacular keyboard, and then only at times. Much of the time I have to click on the Keyman icon in the system tray. Most of the time, as soon as I press Ctrl-N, the keyman keyboard turns off, even though the XP keyboard continues to show vernacular. (I use \lquote Afrikaans\rquote  for the language name in Windows XP.)\par
_On the problem side, when Toolbox does not find a word in the text, it\line gives me a box that says "Lookup Failure. Insert in lexicon?" It then\line displays the text to insert in a garbled fashion. Specifically, it\line displays lower ASCII correctly but substitutes nonsense for everything\line else. This is a minor problem, since only one string is displayed and\line the user can figure out what it is supposed to be.\par

\cf0 I did add some classes to create a "CRichEditLng" similar to your "CEditLng"\line because I wasn't able to get the multi-line "CEdit" controls to display\line correctly with the USP rendering. I just now added the define which turns\line off all of those rich edit changes in stdafx.h, but beware that the Sort\line Primaries (and any other multi-line CEditLng) box aren't working once again.\line\line I'm attaching what I have to-date. The "RichEdit3.*" and "RichEditLng.*"\line files don't need to be added to the project, though, you might want to keep\line them around for reference. As I said, the fixes they were for are turned off\line with of the "rde534" define in stdafx.h\line\line Here's a summary of the changes I did:\line vrde52t // project closing fatal exception (accepted)\line vrde52tb // fix a problem uncovered by fix rde52t of not resetting the\line 'm_bClosingProjectOrMainFrame' flag on project open (accepted)\line vrde52u // optional use 'alloca' (for stack allocation) instead of malloc (accepted)\line xrde52v // optional use project to show NoMatches dialog when external jump\line doesn't find a match. (removed)\line This has the 'infelicity' of displaying the unmatched string in the project\line default lg encoding, which if it isn't a unicode font will not render a\line unicode string correctly... I don't know how to make this work better... so\line perhaps you should turn it off if you can't think of a better way...\line vrde530 // unicode c/c/p (already in)\line vrde530a // external jump (already)\line vrde531  // Windows' Input Method (IM) support\line There might be a problem with this fix whereby the CEditLng control (e.g.\line in the FindDialog) isn't getting the WM_INPUTLANGCHANGE message when being\line instantiated for a language encoding that uses the same IM keyboard as the\line last field you were on in CShwView (e.g. be on an 'arabic' RTL field in the\line view and type ctrl+F to bring up the find dialog where the last find was on\line the same 'arabic' encoding). It appears to not send me the necessary IM\line message if the keyboard doesn't change (but the keyboard *should* change\line even if it's the same lang encoding because of the kill/set\line focus's???--Perhaps the kill focus 'DeActivateKeyboards' isn't turning off\line system IM keyboards,  but rather only Keyman??). My system is in a bad\line state, however, as far as the IM stuff goes (I still can't get TransRoman to\line work as a system shadow keyboard) so I can't tell if it's just me or the\line code... but just FYI if you experience it also.\line vrde531c // fix the multiple monitor problem that Dan McCloy was experiencing (accepted)\par
xrde532 // use EN_ versions of Set/Kill focus to fix cursor problem. (in, but no good, so def off)\line vrde533  // tell SSA about right-to-left (accepted)\line for this change, I'm not sure it was needed, so you could perhaps leave it\line off if you get RTL working otherwise\line xrde534  // make the sort primaries control a richedit CEditLng isn't\line working for multi-line controls... (not in at all)\line\line Of course, you already have some of this, though I've tried to clean up the\line conditional compile stuff a bit... Have fun!\par

\tab May take as long as into Apr-May\par

New possible plan for port Oct 25 2005\par
These ideas came from considering a dialog box-less Tbx\par
\tab Such a Tbx could display and edit, but not change settings\par
\tab Settings could be modified by running real Tbx on Windows\par
\tab Getting that far would allow a lot of testing\par
\tab Also dialog box work could happen during and after first port\par
Build complete new source from scratch\par
\tab This lets me have a running program all the way along\par
\tab This lets me clean up the source as I go along\par
At each stage, just display enough to show it is working\par
\tab Start with settings, reading cntrl files and loading structs\par
\tab Those things don't need any interface\par
\tab They can show enough to prove they are working\par
This also allows the main Tbx to not get messed up by port\par
\tab It can continue to grow some enhancements as desired\par
\tab Most enhanced code will be in parts not yet ported\par
\tab If enhancements are in ported code, they can be brought in\par
Change from CrypSolve to the new Tbx as my base\par
\tab Start it as doc/view right away, that is the right foundation\par
\tab Maybe even keep some crypsolve code in for general testing?\par
\tab Easier to use CrypSolve because I couldn't do multiple on Mac\par
\tab But CrypSolve is compiling and running well\par
One big advantage of this approach is that I will enjoy it\par
\tab Experience with IME port says I don't like this kind of port\par
\tab The long work to get it to compile is really hard\par
\tab The fear that when it does compile it will be full of bugs is bad\par
\tab I work incrementally, and this big port is not incremental\par
\tab Also, porting this way breaks existing code\par
\tab\tab It mixes enhancements with unreliable ported code\par
\tab\tab This is not working very well, and it is not a wise thing to do\par
\tab But the incremental approach lets me run and test each step\par
Another big advantage is that I can do full cleanup as I go along\par
\tab The source really needs a lot of cleaning, so that is great\par
Another big advantage is that I can show progress\par
\tab I will have runnable partial ports that I can report and show\par
\tab This will give watchers a feeling of progress as I go along\par
Sounds great! It's a plan!\par
\par
_Use Build, Project Configurations, Add to make a copy of proj\par
\tab that can be customized for the wx build\par
\tab\tab See doc under "project configurations" in index\par
_Work on port to wxString, make a list of types of errors\par
>_Eliminate TEST_ALL and other TEST sections\par
\tab >_Remove ind_t.cpp & h, nothing of them will be used\par
\tab _AfxFormatString1 and 2 use sprintf\par
\tab _LoadString use non Unicode CString LoadStringA\par
\tab\tab I think I have this already done and that it is all right\par
\tab\tab Think about the implications\par
\tab\tab Every load string will force ASCII, so no conversion\par
\tab\tab From there it should be all right\par
\tab Convert on copy wxString to CString member var for dialog box\par
\tab And opposite convert on copy back the other way\par
Never pass anything through a CString without converting it\par
\tab Does LoadStringA pass things through a CString?\par
\tab\tab Probably so\par
\tab I don't know what happens on LoadStringA into CString\par
\tab\tab Probably something bad\par
\tab\tab Almost surely it tries to convert it somehow\par
\tab\tab It has to in order to get ANSI into UTF16\par
\tab And if the resource isn't UTF16 and I do LdStrW?\par
\tab\tab Who knows\par
\tab\tab It seems tricky and dangerous\par
Probably best is do 1.3 soon and let 1.4 be untranslatable\par
Now that I am into modifying string source, I might be able to\par
\tab modify CString source in MFC to prevent Unicode convert\par
Better alternative is to do two more port steps as part of IME\par
\tab String resources into code (avoids LoadString into CString)\par
\tab Dialog boxes (avoids CString member variables for controls)\par
\tab\tab Alternative is to use direct instead of DDX_Text\par
\tab\tab This is faster than porting the dialog boxes\par
vWrite a short email to committee about this variation of plan\par
I have been acting almost panicked about the port so far\par
\tab When I dig into it I tend to not get email and let it lay around\par
One thing I need to do is to build a scenario I can believe in\par
\tab If this works, then I will have a higher level of hope\par
\tab\tab Hope is one of the things partially missing on the port\par
\tab\tab When I act panicked, it shows I am not hopeful\par
\tab And then accept the scenario and work toward it\par
\tab\tab Fill in the details of how I can get there\par
\tab For example, here are some details\par
\tab\tab vTry download again, take notes on what goes wrong\par
\tab\tab Ask Bill for help getting it to work\par
\tab\tab Get help from Bill until I get the samples to compile\par
\tab\tab Study samples for examples of what I want to do\par
\tab\tab From samples see why Tbx won't include and link\par
\tab Scenario I can believe in? (This was as of Jul 2004)\par
\tab\tab (Note that as of Jan 2005, needs some momths added)\par
\tab\tab Finish release 1.3 by end of Aug (yes)\par
\tab\tab\tab I can believe in this because it is almost done\par
\tab\tab\tab I need to do the last enhancements\par
\tab\tab\tab I can cut off more or less wherever I need to\par
\tab\tab All the non-coding stuff in 1 mo Sep (~yes)\par
\tab\tab First half of port 6 mo Mar (yes, I think so)\par
\tab\tab\tab Help from Karen on dialogs especially\par
\tab\tab\tab Help from Bill on getting set up correctly\par
\tab\tab\tab Time to work away and resolve problems\par
\tab\tab Above port make IME work 1mo Apr (yes, I think so)\par
\tab\tab\tab It appears to be a clean break from CStrings\par
\tab\tab\tab The rest of IME should be not too hard\par
\tab\tab\tab But it is good to give it a month beyond port\par
\tab\tab Last half of port 6 mo Oct (yes, I think so)\par
\tab\tab\tab Seems reasonable for amount of work involved\par
\tab\tab End Aug plus 8 mo is end Apr\par
\tab\tab End Mar plus 6 mo is end Oct\par
\tab\tab\tab That is good for Mac test and release fall 2005\par
\tab\tab\tab Exactly as I said to the committee in Mar email\par
\tab\tab I had told the committee in March to expect fall 2005\par
\tab\tab\tab That was improved from 2006\par
\tab\tab\tab Only Kevin knows I was hoping for spring 2005\par
\tab\tab\tab More likely first full build Mac in summer 2005\par
\tab\tab\tab Then Kevin and others in Ktm can test fall 2005\par

Make IME version ---------------------------------------------\par

\tab Can't make UTF16 from legacy such as Annapurna\par
\tab The main window might be able to display, but shouldn't\par

\tab\tab If no upper ANSI, can make it Unicode\par
\tab\tab If upper ANSI, leave non-Unicode\par

\tab\tab\tab and which legacy lang they use\par
\tab\tab They can remove those flds from db type if not used\par
\tab\tab Or those flds can be changed to another lang\par
\tab\tab\tab Maybe default lang, it is always there\par
\tab The Unicode only version will need distinct name\par
\tab\tab But ToolboxU is confusing, since all are Unicode\par

\tab\tab I think ToolboxIME may be best\par

\cf1 Written for Steve Feb 14, but not sent:\par
My suspicion is that the strongest reason for open source will come when we start to seriously support Linux. There are so many variations in Linux versions that it would take a lot of binaries to support them all. As a result, many programs are provided in source form so that anyone who wants to use them on an obscure version of Linux can compile to make their own binary. Probably many of these "open source" programs are never modified by users at all. But the ability to compile from the source gives a real benefit to some users. \par
This raises a real issue that I would like to discuss further with you before you go to the meetings. I wonder if it might be possible to get permission for SAG to make Toolbox open source in our own way and time, without pressure to do so before we are ready? I realize that raising the issue seriously at all could open a can of worms. But maybe you can test the waters and see if it might be possible to let out just a few worms. If so, maybe they can be put on hooks and dropped in the water to good effect.\par
The point of letting such worms out would be that in general, the Linux source will grow in parallel with the Mac source. When I have a usable subset of Toolbox available for Mac and Linux, then it might be useful to have the option of letting the source out to some Linux users, at least in some limited way. If the port were to go really well, there is a chance I might get to that point before next year's CTAG. \par
One option is to keep the worms in the can for now, and only start to let them out when the time comes that we can put them to use. If we let them out now, they may crawl away, or die before we need them. So I will trust your judgment on whether to broach the subject (the can) at this time or not. \par
Of course, I realize that Dan's motion and the follow-up from it last year may have already opened the can a little bit. But my impression is that it was sort of opened on the wrong end. Maybe I misunderstood, but I though the result was that we were told by Ac Affairs that they could force us to give the source to someone if they so chose, but that we were not authorized to give it out to anyeone else without their permission, and such permission would be considered on a case by case basis. If that is the current status, maybe it would improve if they were to give us an open permission. But I will also be very happy to leave status quo if that is better.\par

Below is used on the tips page of the Toolbox site:\par
\par
The full name of Toolbox is Field Linguist's Toolbox, \par
but almost no one uses the full name, so it can be hard \par
to make a search that finds relevant web sites. Some \par
people use Shoebox/Toolbox. This finds mostly relevant \par
sites. If you want your site to be found, it is good to \par
include that on the site. A search for sites that contain \par
both Shoebox and Toolbox on the same page finds a \par
lot of hits, but only a small percentage are about \par
Shoebox/Toolbox. Some Shoebox/Toolbox sites contain \par
links to other sites, so you may find some useful information \par
by following those links. A few sites use Shoe/Toolbox,\par
but that is very rare, and searching for it brings up mostly\par
irrelevant sites.\par

Field Linguist's Toolbox is a freeware program to help field \par
linguists analyze and publish data, especially dictionaries and \par
interlinear text. This group is to help linguists use Toolbox.\par

vSent welcome below\par
Welcome to the Toolbox list\par
\par
Toolbox is a really useful program, but because it is\par
a box of tools, it has lots of variety and possibilities.\par
I hope this list can help users share helps and ideas\par
with each other.\par
\par
vSent searching below\par
Searching for Toolbox on the web\par
\par
Searching for the word "Toolbox" on the web is obviously\par
worthless, and "Shoebox" is no better. No one seems\par
to spell out the full name "Field Linguist's Toolbox".\par
Sites found by searching for Shoebox/Toolbox are\par
mostly on the right topic. Presumably there are\par
relevant sites that don't use that combination, but they\par
are almost impossible to find. Searching for Shoebox\par
and Toolbox on the same page gives a lot of hits, but\par
almost all are irrelevant, and those that are relevant\par
mostly include Shoebox/Toolbox. One or two sites\par
use Shoe/Toolbox, but that seems to be mostly one\par
person. Looks like Shoebox/Toolbox is the best.\par
\par
Toolbox help available\par
\par
This looks like a useful list, and I hope Toolbox users will \par
benefit from it.\par
\par
I will be lurking on the list, and will try to give help to those\par
who don't seem to get what they need from the list.\par
