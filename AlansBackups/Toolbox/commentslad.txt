vBackup 00dg
vScroll bar correctly at bottom if end of record painted 00dg
vOpen prj files at size and position shown in prj 00df
vTrim spaces off end of typ name before adding .typ 00de
vRead prj file and open files 00de
	Status: detects prj and loads it as a settings file, nothing more
	vMake a simple prj for testing 00da
		Can just pick simple.prj from Windows
			It looks like it will work fine
			It loads SimpleAdapt.txt and SimpleAdapt3.txt
			They are both db typ Simple
			It uses only Default language
		vProbably fix paths by hand for first test
	vSo next step is look for file in settings file and open it 00de
vGet settings tag section include tag 00de
	It may be needed, as in db
vChange SettingsFile to just Settings 00de
	That way it can more naturally be returned from GetSettings
	The way it is, I can't easily look for internal settings
vSettingsTagSection can't return place for next to start 00de
	All object parameters are reference, only ints are not
	vSo pass a Settings for result and change its contents 00de
vBackup 00dd
	vFix version in resource
xDon't allow extra scroll at end unless last fld has mult lines
	No, maybe needed any time extra lines in latter flds
	Leave as is for now, can improve later
vLad: Scroll vertical 00dd
	vRemember current top line in Vw
	vMake DbView extnd JComponent instead of JScrollPane 00dc
	vThey recommend JPanel as a good content pane
	vI need to figure out how to paint the JPanel
		vUses paintComponent 00dc
	vBetter to use JComponent instead of JPanel 00dc
		It doesn't try to invoke a layout manager
	vCan put multiple JComponents into container of JFrame 00dc
		I can size them so they fit however I want
		I think the user can resize any one of them
		I can resize the others when the user does that
		Probably this gives me a lot more control
		For now, just do one in the frame
			Eventually can do different, or maybe best not
	vPut a scroll bar in it 00dc
	>Scroll bar as a component in frame container allows multiples
		This will work for the browse view
		Separate browse scroll bar can be positioned as desired
		Changes to it can be detected to scroll browse
		Boundary position can be used to place it
		Dragging boundary can change its position
	xOverride validate() to lay out compnents, including scroll bar
		Causes nothing to paint at all
	vRemembr frame size, paint redo layout if siz has changed 00dc
		vThat worked well
	vGet scroll bar position setting when painting 00dd
	xSet scroll bar parameters based on record size
	xMeasure record size
		Look at how paint measures lines
	xStore record height in record 00dd
		Set it to zero to initialize, or to force recalculate
		If non-zero, assume it is correct height of record
	vIf iY goes past rectFrame height, stop painting 00dd
		vRemember number of fields painted 00dd
	vSet block increment to number of fields painted minus 2 00dd
		vCheck to make sure it is at least 1 00dd
	vSince scrolling is by fields, use field number as value 00dd
		vDuring paint, count fields that fit 00dd
		vUse that number as extent 00dd
	vSet maximum to total number of fields in record 00dd
		vMake func in rec to return total number of fields 00dd
	vSet var to indicate paint in process to prevent extra paints
	vUse remember and compare technique for scroll bars 00dd
		vRemember current scroll bar pos
		vIf scroll bar has changed from most recent, recalculate pos
	vAllow scroll all the way to the last field 00dd
		vWorking, block increment shrinks at end, but not bad 00dd
	vNext and prev record reset scroll first line 00dd
vLad: Put indent of close brace back to standard Java way 00dd
	Will look better if others see my code
	Will make me more able to read other code
	Won't take long, just left arrow, delete at each
	I find myself slightly confused with current mixed way
vBackup Lad 00db
xLad: Consider putting text in edit controls
	I decided the later hassle would be greater than saving
	Maybe saves some work, maybe not
	Same measurement to place cntrls as to paint text
	Gives a lot of early functionality
		Mouse click in cntrl gives it focus and shows cursor
		Arrows work within the cntrl
		Editing insert and delete work within the cntrl
	Karen is in favor of no hard line breaks in file
		All fields would wrap on the fly
		This might make edit control possible
vLad: Open file even if no project
	vLooks in same folder for typ & lng
vAdd File, Save to save after standardize 00cw
	vTest with Simple.txt
Backup 00cv
vStandardize record structure in Lad 00cv
	vPick up record structure from db typ 00cj
	xOpen new db for the standardized form
		No, make backup and modify current db
	vBreak record structure into array of strings 00ct
	vFor each record 00ct
	vFor each field name in record structure 00ct
	vFor field in record 00ct
		vIf matches field in record structure 00ct
			If first time, put new into record
			Else, not first time, append
	vSave a backup of file first 00ct
		vName it Backup *.*
		Then I can replace the record with new one
	vMake a way to write the db file 00ct
		vAllow writ to a diffrnt name for backup 00ct
	vUse structure outline to standardize records 00cv
		vAppend with semicoln if more thn one 00cu
		vTest with different order 00cu
		vDon't append if empty 00cv
		vAdd new empty field if not found 00cv
vBackup 00ct
vMake a variant of iWrite with no nl 00ct
vGive message if no record structure 00cs
vDo marker inventory on Kevin dict
Backup 00cr
Make marker inventory 00cm
	vAdd Checks menu for it 00cm
	vAdd nums to Mkr 00cm
	vAdd func to clear all Mkr nums in MkrLst 00cm
	vHow many occurrences of each marker 00cn
	vHow many have content
	vBuild info in mkrlst of typ 00cn
		vFor each fld of each rec 00cn
			vIncr num of flds 00cn
			vIf not empty, incr num of cont
	vPrint counts to verify it is working 00cn
	vMake BufferedWriter function 00cp
	vOut \mkr mrkr \num total \cont non-empty 00cq
		viNum, iNumWithContent 00cq
		vShow mkr without backslash 00cq
	vPut hdr wth db typ in MarkerInventory.txt 00cq
	vOpen MarkerInventory.txt file in Lad 00cr
First and Last record don't repaint changed rec 00ck
vPut command on menu to standardize recs 00cj
	(By analogy of other menus)
	vAdd Tools top menu 00cj
	vAdd Standardize records to Tools 00cj
	vMake it call function to do this 00cj
		vGoes in db type
vGetSettingsTagSectn retrn only content, not tags 00ch
vEdit Simple.typ to put in Record structure
	vChoose a tag for it
	\+RecordStructure
Possible system for new code
	Choose the upcoming version for the code
	Make comment pseudo code with version
	Search for that version and fill them in
vPick up database type file on file open 00cg
	vIf db type does not exist
		vBuild typ file name
		vBuild typ path using db path (later prj path)
		vOpen typ file path as typ settings file
	vSave path of file or prj in Prj
		xSave as File? maybe so
		vSave as sProjectFolder
vIndent system change to more like I use in C++ 00cf
	Keep open curly in line, that saves a line
	Move close curly to line up with indented
		Keys my eye same as C++
		Easier to type, auto indent same as above
	I cn see at a glanc I would find this easier to read
	This is like my thinking file hanging indent style
	Any problems? Probably not
		Compiler doesn't mind
			Unlike Python that relies on indent
			I like this a lot better
	If someone else looks at it, so what
vBackup Highland work Kevin

vStudy Tibetan script
vPut in XenoType font and call for it 00ce
	Renders much worse than default
vPut in Devanagari MT font and call for it 00ce
	Doesn't render any better than default
	But now default renders correctly
vDeal with fail to render Dev 2h
	vProbably needs font
	vTest whether it renders in text edit
		vDoesn't even display Dev
		Don't know where Lad gets Dev font
		Arial U MS doesn't rendr or do conjncts
	vI need to get with somebody
		vSee what their machine does
			vPackage to run on somebody else

	vDefault to LadTest
vBrng Daniel stuff out f email onto Mac nd unzip it
vAdd mkrs to Kevin's text files N21 & N29

vDifferent font for line than markers 00bz
vMeasure and move down before paint 00bz
Backup 00by
vAdd iAdjustSpacing to allow user to adjust 00by
vStart first line correctly 00by

vMeasure markers to get max width 00br
Don't need a VwLst
	Each Db will have one or more views
	If multiple, they will be in JSplitPane panes
		Probably make DbSplitPane frm JSplitPane
	I can walk through the panes to find them
		That will be sufficient for what I need
	Maybe Vw nests inside Db
		That way it can easily access its Db
vInclude horizontal scroll bar 00bq
	Without it drag corner covers lower arrow of vert
vMake DbScrollPane visible 00bq
 vDbScrollPane goes into contentPane f DbFrame 00bq
	It is a container

vDbView is set as the viewport of DbScrollPane 00bp
vMake DbView 00bp
	DbView is a subclass of JViewPort
vBackup 00bn
vMake DbFrame to be the outer frame 00bn
	It can be in Prj because multiples in a Prj
	Vw also can be in Prj because multiples in frame
	vConsider whether the existing Lad can be it?
		No, seems in wrong relationship to Prj
vMake LadFrame nd see if I can get it to come up 00bn
vConstrctr of empty Prj makes Empty frame 00bj
vMake EmptyFrame nd see if cn get it to come up 00bk

		Yes, wx has Lng, Mkr, Typ, Fld, Rec, Db
vBackup 0.0ap
vMake bFileOpen give error messages 0.0ap
Backup 0.0an
vInstantiate all member variables 0.0an
vMake Db have a read function 0.0am
	What does wxLad do?
		Db has bFileOpen and FileSave
	DbLst is not used at all in wxLad
	Better to use, even if partially redundant w/Vw
vRead one line at a time 0.0ak
vFile read will use BufferedReader 0.0aj
	BufferedReader wrapper on InputStreamReader
	InputStreamReader has Charset constructor
	UTF-8 is an available Charset

vMake Lng and LngLst classes
	vMake Lng class
		Has sName and SettingsFile as members
	vMake LngLst
	vTry adding Lng without override of Add
		That works fine
		It allows wrong derived class to be added
			But that is unlikely to happen
			Compiler wouldn't block, even if ovrd
To make a new class (has to be in its own file)
	Choose File, New File, Pure Java, Java class

vAdd member functions to Lst 0.0aa
vReview need for Lsn
	Not needed, didn't gain hardly anything

Lad =========================
Lad record structure template thoughts
	"Record structure" as name, K and I both like
	Edit in a text box
	Use + for repeating, or * for repeating
	Use - for optional, or + for required
	Use indent for hierarchy
	Repeat applies to all under in hierarchy
	Each \lx (rec marker) starts alternative structure
		xUse / for alternative with next at same level
	But what about optional above required?
		Sense number is optional, but high up
		Under it is required, even if it is not present
		Maybe requird under optionl will work OK
>Lad: Allow for plain text file
_Use remember and compare technique for wrapping
	Store most recent wrap value in each record
	If width of paint is different, rewrap and store new value
	On write, wrap records that are not wrapped at current val
		On read they can all be assumed wrapped at db val
_Don't allow last Db of real project to close
_Check for errors returned from iFileOpen
_On prj open, close prev prj and db's
_Fix paths in settings file based on previous loc of prj file
_Get font from lng
	_Pick up lng files
