God opened her heart.
\p <MM Again, line 07 is unclear as to
exactly what they are telling Lydie.  In
the retelling it says they spoke "God's
Words" to her.  We may make this more
explicit.>
\ln 58.08
\ret
\ln 58.09
\ret And they went to her house and
stayed several days there. She and
her family were baptized. 
\p <MM From the original story, the
retelling chronologically mixes up the
order of her and her family being
baptized with them staying several days
at her house.>
\p {DP So what will you do? Is this ok? 
Might it make the baptism seem less
immediate?}
\ln 58.10a
\ret One dayÖ...  Then, they left and went
on.   To Ö.?? 1:54 ...  One woman was
there, a worker.
\p <MM The fact that Paul and Silas were
going to "God's praising place" was not
retold in the same fashion.  Again, this is
something we will adjust to match the
Supyire NT draft.  See CN discussion.>
\ln 58.10b
\ret A demon was in her.  She told the
future
\p {ÔDP "in her" versus "haunted by", what
does the Supyire NT have?  Which
corresponds to the more traditional
expression about what demons do? /// 
"made her" is left out.  Is this
necessary?  If people understand from
the simpler way that it was the demon
making her, it wouldn't be necessary?}
\ln 58.11
\ret Öand gave the money to her owners.
\ln 58.12
\ret She was following close behind
them and saying, "These are the
saviors?????
\p <MM In the retelling, the exact words
that the demon girl was shouting to Paul
were not remembered.  He also
mistakenly said she was saying, "These
are the saviors."  We will relook at this
section, possibly using repetition to
make it clearer and more
rememberable.  Or cohesively use what
is used in line 01 to describe Good News
as what the demon-possessed girl is
saying Paul and Silas are doing?>
\ln 58.13
\ret These hurt Paul.      
\ln 58.14
\ret And Paul said, "I beg you God (have
pity God).  Demon leave the
woman." And the demon left the
woman. 
\p <MM In line 14, the phrase "In the name
of Jesus" was omitted.  However, this is
important to show the transfer of the
power and authority of Jesus to those
who follow Him.>
\p {DP What does Supyire NT have for this
phrase?  It may not be commonly used,
or it may have some different
understanding by the hearers than what
is intended.  If the phrase is not clear it
wouldn't be showing "the transfer of the
power and authority of Jesus to those
who follow Him" that you are wanting to
get across.}
\ln 58.15
\ret After that, the owners, they were
getting money, were no longer
getting money.
\ln 58.16a
\ret They went and captured Paul with
strength and took him to the
authorities.
\p {DP Captured with strength - might this
be a more natural expression than
"arrested".  Or is it just a translation
difference, and the Supyire is the same?}
\ln 58.16b
\ret And said these things they are doing,
they can not accept/agree to do them.  
\p (3:00 - 3:06)??
\p {DP The omission of "made disorder" is
something to note.  The testing seems to
show that it is understood.  But if it is not
a natural enough or common enough
way of expressing this so as to be easily
reproducible, it could be simplified.}
\ln 58.17
\ret They took their clothes off them and
beat them and put them in prison.
\p <MM There is a bit of repetition in line 17
and 18 that was not in the retelling.  This
could potentially be shortened.>
\ln 58.18
\ret
\ln 58.19
\ret And told the prison guard to guard
them a lot.
\ln 58.20
\ret The prison guard laid them in the
small room and tied them with chain
to wood.
\p {DP In line 18, the location of the "small
room" was not in the retelling and could
be omitted as it's importance in the story
is not great.}
\p {DP Note "chain" is added in the retelling
- wonder if is significant, it's mentioned
several lines later, so we might wonder
of the re-teller mentions it cuz to not
mention may imply tying with something
more normal, e.g. rope?} 
\ln 58.21
\ret When the earth was cold, they were
praising God, and singing, and
praying to God. The prison people
who had entered? listened to
them.  
\ln 58.22
\ret Then, the house shook.  
\p <MM Instead of saying the "earth shook
and the prison walls shook", in the
retelling he said "the house shook". 
However, these are details that should
be left in the story.  God's power is seen
in being able to shake the earth.  It was
touched on in the questioning.>
\p {DP Are you sure that's natural? 
Instead of deciding yourselves that this
should be less, take this as something
that you should test - e.g. "Why do you
think this says "the earth shakes"
instead of something like "the house
shakes"?}
\ln 58.23
\ret The house door opened.  The metal
rope that tied them cut.  [4:05 -
4:11 ROOSTER (couldn't hear this
portion)]  Öand the prison house Öand
the power Ö the door opened
\ln 58.24
\ret the prison guard searched for a
knife
\p {DP "searched for" vs "took"Ö this should
generate a testing question or sequence
as well.  If the original version makes
hearers think the jailer had to search for
some/any knife in the area, versus
taking his own weapon, it should be
revised.}
\ln 58.25
\ret Then Paul said with strength, "You
don't have to catch us . We are all
here."
\p {DP "You don't have to catch usÖ" - That
is quite far from the sense it is supposed
to have. That is part of what suggests
asking the testing questions in the line
above.  After the retelling, if you are
doing the testing questions with the
same person or group as was doing the
retelling, and if you notice this sort of
variance, it would be worth adding
another testing question on this part,
something like:  "When you retold this
part you said Paul had said 'You don't
have to catch us'.  Could you help me
understand why you thought Paul would
have said this?}
\ln 58.26
\ret He went and looked for a light, and
ran to them, and fell down in front
of Paul and Silas.
\ln 58.27
\ret He willed to be be released of his
sin.
\ln 58.28
\ret And they said, "Trust in Jesus.  If
you trust in Jesus, you will be
released from your sins"
\p <MM In line 28, the word in the original
story "accept" was retold as being
"trust".  The word in the Supyire NT draft
is what is used in the original and it is
understood.  Therefore, we will leave
this word as is.>
\p {DP Note that the retelling has direct
quote.  Is this more vivid?} 
\ln 58.29a
\ret
\p <MM Line 29, the fact that they shared
God's words with the guards household
was not retold.  However, this is
important to leave in the story. >
\p {DP This may be an indication that the
tightly packed "told God's words" is not
very natural. It may be that if it is
expanded it might be more reproducible,
e.g. "taught them more about what it
means to trust Jesus".  Exegetical
support for this is in the Marshall
commentary (in TW) for this verse.}
\ln 58.29b
\ret He and all his family were
baptized.   
\ln 58.30
\ret And they praised God.  
\p {DP This was truncated in the retelling. 
Could the story be simplified?}
\ln 58.31
\ret When the morning opened, those
who are the judge came to the
prison guard to let Paul and Silas
go, to release their hands. 
\ln 58.32
\ret They let Paul and Silas go.   They
went to call on Lydie. To the
believers Ö.to ??? (cannot hear
retelling here, few seconds only)
Take the road
\ln 58.33
\ret Then they left and went on.    
\p {DP Does a story need something like
this to resolve it in a more satisfying
way?}
