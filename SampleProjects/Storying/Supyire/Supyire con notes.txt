everything for content, cohesion and chronology

\con DP Please note the order and format that I've
adjusted the tag / abbreviation lines to in the
lines immediately above.  We like these to be in
reverse chronological order labeling each of the
times the consultant or facilitators interact in
chronological order from bottom to top, so that
the topmost thing in this file (besides the
identification of the story) will be the date and
identification of who did the latest work on the
story. Please adjust all the subsequent stories to
be in the format of the above, and re-send them
to me.  Thanks. ...
\fac MM3:  okay
\con DP (CONTINUED)... Notice also that it helps to
separate these tag lines from the preceding lines
of info, and the following notes, separating them
by a "\p" paragraph marker, just to give a little
space between the different kinds of
information.  That sort of spacing to separate
different kinds of items will help us to visually
navegate in this con notes file.  I use it
elsewhere as well, e.g. to separate unrelated
exchanges between the consultant and team in
one particular verse.
\fac MM3:  okay
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con DP Note that I've changed this to story 01,
rather than 00.  I think I've asked about this
earlier.  We need to distinguish this from the 00
Introductory record.  So please change your BT
file to be 01 in the "\c" line, as well as in each of
the line numbers.
\fac MM3:  okay, it is changed now.  
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con LB2 You have done a lot of good work on this
story. Much of what seemed confusing is cleared
up. Well done.
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con LB2 re<retelling> Could you still say, how the
retelling went. Detail included, excluded. How
learnable is it with the current degree of detail?
\fac MM3:  See additional testing information.
\con LB2  <There is only line 8  in the story that
currently shows any need for adjustment.
However, it still lacks the indication of testing in
the file.  Test with "how" and "why" type of
questions, which might reveal worldview issues
you may miss otherwise. You may have done
that, as I know you have done much testing.
Still, you should show both questions and
answers in your BT file.> I have read some of
your concerns about the tst questions and the
responses and frustrations of the test groups.
We don't want to weary or frustrate them, but
you should have some of these types of
questions. I appreciate you working with both
sides and the delicate balance you seek to
achieve.
\fac MM2:  See testing comments as they have been
inserted in the file.  We will make adjustments
on line 8 as suggested.
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con DP I'm just putting a placeholder note here that
we are having a discussion of the retelling part of
testing in other email interaction.  So some
further comments about your evaluation of
retelling may be something I'll want to address
later.  Generally, the degree of information you
are giving here seems about normal.  What you
are doing to address it is addressed below.
\con DP (CONTINUED)... Generally when a team
reports some variances in the retold story (like
getting things out of order chronologically, or
leaving out a crucial line), there would be some
indication of how this is going to be addressed in
a revision (usually a simplification).  There are
few details to further consider (immediately
below).
\con DP (CONTINUED).... What was the part that was
out of order chronologically?
\fac MM3:  See additional "General Testing
Comments, Tst3"
\con DP (CONTINUED)... I can certainly understand
not wanting to leave out a crucial part (like about
the good relationship) since you say it is a theme
for the set.   But, see the points below
specifically about this in line 23.
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con DP For the probing questions, the number of
those you have in this story now is adequate. So
you would not need to retest all of those with the
final testing respondent for the probing
questions.  The only new testing questions of the
"how / why" sort are those I've noted specifically
in the DP comments below.  In this story, the
only ones are at line 11.
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  However, if all your testing
questions and responses have been done in
French to this point, then I will likely want to
revise what I've said immediately above.  The
testing by this point should be done consistently
in Supyire language.
\fac MM3:  No, all our testing is done in Supyire. 
However, from time to time, we have someone
who is listening to our story or has come to be a
part of the testing group who speaks French, and
from time to time they like to explain what
certain Supyire words or phrases mean by using
the French language as a bridge.  But you are
correct in assuming our testing is done
consistently in Supyire language.
\con DP2 great to read this, sounds good!
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con DP The line that says "Revised 7/1/08" -- Does
this refer to the most recent revision of the audio
recording?  I'm expecting that the new file you
sent on 08Aug08 might then only be a revision of
the material in the BT file.  For better tracking
this sort of information, it would be good to
indicate that, e.g. Audio of story revised 01Jul08,
and then on another line, BT file revised
08Aug08, or something like that.  (The reason I
say this is that I was a little confused as to
whether I might not have the most recent
version of your BT file. Labeling it in this way will
help.) Thanks.
\fac MM3:  Yes, we will start labelling in this manner. 
It was not explained to us that this was the
purpose of the line, but we have only been
updating the Revision line if it involved an Audio
Revision.
\con DP2 ok
\p
\con DP3 You mention at line 11 below that you would
be testing the oral reproducibility of a phrase  to
make sure it is understandable and retellable. 
Right ... since the previous testing of retelling
indicated a number of things that didn't get
included in the retelling, another testing of
retelling (and seeing what happens with this
phrase) will be good. I'd like you to again
backtranslate this new retelling and send it to
me  Please compare the details of the recording
of the retelling as we did with the Jailer story,
and report on variances and how you plan to
address them.
\fac MM5:  See latest BT file.  This has been retested
and BT of retelling sent.  Testing questions to
probe more about this "tree" have been included
in line 11 of BT as "Tst 3 (Retest)"  See also
attached file of BT of retelling and comments
from that.
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con DP-F > DP-F2 Could I ask you to reorganize the
"reason" comments at the beginning of each of
your stories.  The model that we've used in
training sets, and would prefer to see in the
panoramas like these, would have the comments
divided up in categories like:
\p Redemptive Theme  
\p Worldview / SelectionIssues 
\p Basic Biblical concepts 
\p Cohesion / Background 
\p (So rather than being so much of a summary of
the story, it's specific rationale based on the
kinds of features that characterize a panorama.)
Take a look at some of the stories in the animist
set as an example of some of these.
\fac MM-F2:  This has been updated.
\con DP-F3 ok
\p
\ln 01.01
\con DP Re the proposed anchor <2Ti.03:16) for the
line <This is something that happened which is
also true>, I've seen some discussion between
you and Liesel, but I'm not sure if there was a
resolution to that, or what story that might be
in....
\con DP (CONTINUED)... The basic issue is that this
particular verse doesn't directly involve the
concept that scripture is "true".  It says that it is
"inspired" and "useful", but that is a bit different
than saying it is "true". We might deduce that
something that is inspired from God has to be
true, but even for what underlies that inference,
we'd like to see support.
\con DP (CONTINUED)... The following verses from
certain published versions in English can be
used:  Psa.119:142 (New Century Version)
"...your teachings are true"; Psa.119:160 (NIV)
"all your words are true"; Jhn.17:17 "your word
is truth".
\con DP (CONTINUED)... Since you use this phrase as
an introduction for all the stories, if you prefer
for simplicity, you could give this information
(i.e. the notion that you are using this for all the
stories, as well as the anchors) in your 00
Supyire Project Intro file, and just refer to that in
the rest of the stories.
\fac MM3:  Anchors will be added to each story as
you suggested.  We will leave this intro and
anchoring in each of the individual stories so
they can stand alone.
\con DP2 OK
\p
\ln 01.02
\con LB2 re<God> key term. I see you have included
it now in your L&C notes. Good. Could just add,
if this is the same as in the Sup. NT, please. In
fact, that would help to know with all of them,
where you know they are the same.
\fac MM2:  Yes, this is the same as in the NT
Supyire.  The L&C Notes have been adjusted.
\con DP In the updated L&CNotes file you sent
recently, the word for God has <klie> as the
main entry, and <kile> throughout the entry. Is
there some variation in spelling like this?  Are
both right?  We want the entry to be as correct
as possible so that future workers who may have
access to this material can make the best use of
the BT file and L&C Notes. Thanks.
\fac MM3:   No, it is a typing error.  The word is Kile.
\con DP2 ok, thanks
\p
\con DP Please remove the tst <What was there in
the beginning?  What existed?  Nothing. There
was nothing except God.>
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Here at this near-final stage
I am going to suggest your removal of several
testing questions that are not of the worldview,
probing type.  The reason for this is that we want
the archived version of the documentation to
reflect the kind of process that other OS teams
(or perhaps others who may work with Supyire)
can look at.  If there are a number of testing
questions that are not of the probing sort beyond
what the story says, then it will be confusing to
others who may have cause to look at this
documentation.
\fac MM3:  Okay.  So, we are not to maintain a
record of "non-world-view-probing questions."
The level of understanding of the story will
assume to be checked based on re-telling.  Is
this correct?  You do not need to see
"understanding story content" questions.  Do you
want us to go ahead and remove these, or do
you prefer to state exactly which questions you
want removed in each story?
\con DP2 I'd rather you go ahead and remove the
ones that are basically content questions whose
answers are right in the text.  If there are some
of those that did end up generating some
significant findings, then please keep them,
though as I've suggested elsewhere, I'd
appreciate it if you could modify the content
question to just say something like <On testing
the understanding of ....>
\fac MM4: okay
\ln 01.03
\con LB re<created the water> the <Gen.01:06>
anchor does not support this. Water was already
there at that point. God seperated the water into
water above and below.
\fac MM:  In testing this story, this was often the
most liked part of the story, when God created
the water.  Water is so important here and holds
such an important place. This is obviously
anchorable as it is implied in vs 2 that when God
created the earth, he created water... why?
because after God created the earth, the water
was on it.  I will add other anchors to this.
\con LB1 re<created the water> your  statement
could be left as is. It could be taken as implicit
information "God created the heavens and the
earth" made explicit, specifically including the
water. Here is an anc from Translator's
workplace: The heavens and the earth is the
Hebrew way of speaking of all that existed. It is
an idiom made up of two opposites, like the
expression “good and evil,” and in this context it
means the universe, or everything in the
universe, and not just the earth and the sky. So
your rendering is o.k.
\fac MM:  Thank you.  I have included the anchor
from Translator's Workspace that you mention.
\con LB2 o.k.  
\con DP Following up a bit more on this, we had an
interesting experience a couple of weeks ago in
South Asia in a training session with eleven
mother-tongue teams.  One of the teams was
having a similar issue as the discussion above is
getting at about water being part of creation of
the earth.  Come to find out, they had always
understood from the LWC Bible that God created
heaven and the dirt / ground.  But since it wasn't
explicitly stated that he created water, and since
the word for dirt / ground didn't seem to indicate
other things on the world included in it (like
water), then their understanding was that God
didn't make that, it already existed -- must have
existed eternally with God???.  So for them it
was absolutely essential to make it explicit that
God created the water, as your story has done.
\con DP (CONTINUED...).  Might this be part of what is
at issue with the needed inclusion of water in
Supyire?  Does the word for <earth> that is
used in Supyire here basically mean <dirt>, and
not the planet earth / world like we understand it
in English, which would include the water?  Is the
word you used for <earth>  in the story the
same as was used in the Supyire Genesis draft
translation?
\fac MM3:  Yes, you are absolutely correct.  The word
for "earth" here, which is the same word used in
the Supyire draft, means literally dirt or ground. 
It does not include the water. Therefore, when it
says God made the heavens and earth, it is not
explicit that He put the water on earth.  It is
made explicit for this reason.
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  If you find out that the
Supyire word used for <earth / dirt> would NOT
include any water, and the assumption people
make is that unless it is specified it would mean
God did NOT make the waters -- they were
already there, and if the Supyire Genesis draft
has the same word for <earth / dirt>, this is
exactly the kind of feedback the translation team
would be very keen to know for the translation
itself. 
\fac MM3:  Based on our testing and probing, it is not
understood that the water pre-existed with God
before the earth was made.  They understand
God to have made the water, because they
understand God to be the Creator God, creator
of everything.  Based on a previous test
question, they understand that nothing existed
before the world was created execpt for God.
However, this is such an important aspect of life
here,  it is made explicit in the story.
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  One more question in this
string:  Is the Supyire word backtranslated
<world> in line 2 the same as the Supyire word
in line 3 backtranslated as <earth>?  In story 48
line 06, in the con notes file responding to a
question about the word <world>, you say
<MM:  The word here used for "world" means
"world", not "earth" not "ground", but the entire
"world". It is the same word as in the creation
story when God created the "world".>  So it is
curious why different words might have been
used in line 02 versus line 03 here. Which of
these two terms are you referring to in your
48:06 comment?
\fac MM3:  No, the word for "world" in line 2 is
different from the word "earth" as used in line 3. 
The word used in story 48 is the same word as
"world" used in line 2 here. The Supyire word for
"world" does include both land and water and
sky and the people in it, while the word for
"earth" only literally means ground/land/dirt.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) The above issues on
<earth> and <water> are something you should
be able to work out with the crafter directly.  I'm
not suggesting that they need to be tested.
\fac MM3:  We discussed this with our craftor and he
is the one who gave us the information included
above.
\con DP2 Thanks for your responses on this.  I'd ask
you to add a crafting note on this line in the BT
file that further justifies the inclusion of <created
the water>.   That crafting note can be what you
have said further above... i.e. <The word for
"earth" here, which is the same word used in the
Supyire draft, means literally dirt or ground.  It
does not include the water. Therefore, when it
says God made the heavens and earth, it is not
clear that He put the water on earth.  It is made
explicit for this reason.>
\fac MM4:  Okay, crafting note has been added.
\con DP-F Interesting that <water> didn't make it into
the retelling you have recorded here. Did it
make it into some of the other retellings?
\fac MM-F:  Yes.  
\con DP-F2 ok
\p
\con LB2 re<the heavens> Now that you have this
word, could you please enter it into the
L&Cnotes. Please test, what is included in the
term "heavens".
\fac MM2:  It is the same word as used in the Supyire
NT draft here.  It actually literally translates "the
area above".  We will ask further what is
included in the term.  See testing question and
L&C Note.
\con DP Since you have this in the L&C notes now,
please remove the crafting note and tst material
here.  One quick matter in the L&CNotes entry,
I'm not real clear on the sentence <In testing we
have found the understand to mean "ciel" in
French.>  Can you fix that up a bit to be
clearer?  Thanks.
\fac MM3:  Okay, this testing question has been
removed from the file.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Also in the L&CNote entry,
please include a reference to this story and line. 
Actually, LB's suggestion that this be included in
the L&CNotes was based on the assumption that
heaven would be referred to in other stories. 
I've searched through all the remaining stories
and don't find <heaven> in the BT line and there
are none.  There are some cases of <above> in
the BT line that seem to be referring to heaven,
e.g. 28.05 28.15, 50:21, 52:02, 52:04, 54:07
56:02 60:28 60:30.  If <above> is the normal
way this appears in the BT, then the entry in the
L&CNotes should have in the <\r> line as
"above".  And then in the entry should say that it
is the way of expressing <heaven>. Then if you
have a BT line like in this case where it says
<heavens> rather than <above>, put in the BT
line afterward [KT above], and it should
automatically link from there to the key term
entry for all these cases, including the one in this
story.
\fac MM3:  Okay, this is the case.  The word for
"above" is used in all of these stories and it has
been changed in the KT list and BT file as you
suggested.
\con DP2 Thanks.  Could you send me the revised
L&C Notes file?
\fac MM4:  Okay. Sent 9/1/08
\ln 01.04a
\con LB re<And let all the kinds of trees to rise on the
earth.> It would be better to bring this line in
after the creation of light and before line 2.06.
\fac MM:  Yes, I will rearrange this chronologically.
\con LB1 o.k. much better chronological arrangement
now.
\con DP-F2 ok
\p
\con DP Please divide this line into three lines, 04a,
04b, 04c, corresponding to the the three vss
from Gen 1, i.e. v2, v3 and v4. The general
notion for how much to put in a line is a sentence
or clause, though it can sometimes be a couple
of sentences, e.g. if one is a repetition.  It is
occasionally ok to have two verses anchoring a
single line, as you have for line 05 or line 11,
where it is summarizing.  But for this line the
division into three would make it much clearer
what pieces come from what verses.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) There are two reasons we
urge toward this degree of consistency on the
amount of material in a line:  (a) It is
considerably more difficult for the team and the
consultant to evaluate the accuracy in terms of
anchors unless there is minimal material per
line, and unless it is transparent what part of
what verse is supporting the particular line; (b)
The number of probing testing questions
(roughly half as many questions as there are
lines of story) is based on this consistent amount
of material per line.  With too much material in a
line, there will not be adequate testing.
\fac MM3:  Okay, this has been modified.  
\ln 01.05
\con LB re<created light> This line would be good to
have right after your introductory sentence.
Could you include that it was dark already. He
only had to create/say: let there be light.
\con LB re<created the darkness> no anchor for this.
\fac MM:  Yes, I will rework this..  
\con LB1 o.k. looks good now
\ln 01.06
\con LB2 Good change with more content.
\p
\con DP Please divide this line into a b etc. as per my
comments in line 04 above.  The anchor
<Gen.01:14 - 18> seems to have been ok for
the old version of this line, but not the new one. 
So in dividing it up, please get the appropriate
anchors for the right parts.
\fac MM3:  Okay, this has now been revised.  
\ln 01.07
\con DP As you have done in other places, please
give the source of the annotation in square
brackets in the BT line.  Thanks.
\fac MM3:  Okay.  
\ln 01.08
\con LB re<He named him Adam>  would need an
anc. Perhaps you could add some other
explanation such as possibly from footnotes in
Bible translations or exegetical helps, etc. You
could say as in TN on Gen.3.20 The man was
called Adam. - Good to see you use cultural
observations to introductions of name here.  TN
supports this..
\fac MM:  Yes, thank you.  I will add the TN notes to
the anchor.  See adjusted BT.
\con LB2 re<He named him Adam> Sorry, I don't
think I made it clear enough above. When I
suggested the TN rendering "the man was called
Adam", that's what needed changing Monica.
Your backtranslation still says "He named him
Adam" There is not adequate support for the
notion that it was God who did the naming.
Please change this still.
\fac MM2:   Okay, we will adjust this line.  
\con DP Still expecting the adjustment above.  One
other item now in you anc note... The last part,
which says <Each time 'aDam is used in Hebrew,
English versions translate it in different ways.>
isn't quite right.  This would seem to indicate that
English versions use a different word each time
the Hebrew word <Adam> occurs???  Better to
say something like <English translations of
Genesis vary somewhat as to when they
transition from translating the Hebrew word
"Adam" as "man" to translating it with the name
"Adam".>
\fac MM3:  Okay, the anchor has been adjusted and
we will adjust the audio file and BT file.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Please omit the comment
<In the Supyire Genesis draft, the first place the
use of the man's name, "Adama" occurs is Gen
3:20.  However, in storying it is more culturally
appropriate to introduce the character by name
early on.>  The first part of it is ok, but not
really necessary.  (The consultant wouldn't
question this based on where the Supyire
translation makes the shift to calling him Adam.) 
It is the second part of the comment (more
culturally appropriate) that would need
considerably more testing results to justify it.  So
best just to omit it.
\fac MM3: okay.  omitted.
\con DP-F The retelling worded this as <And named
him Adama>... rather than <His name was
Adam>.  Was this testing respondent perhaps
remembering an earlier version?  That's what
I'm assuming from your comment in later in the
testing of retelling.
\fac MM-F:  Yes, that is most probable.  
\con DP-F2 ok

\ln 01.09
\con LB2 re<garden> could you put this into your L&C
note file. Is this the word used in the Genesis
draft of Senufo?
\fac MM2:  Yes, we will add to L&C.  Yes, this was a
word that has been changed to match that of the
NT draft.
\con DP2 ok
\p
\con DP-F Re <the garden>, with <the> it sounds like
the garden should have already been introduced
in the story (like God made a garden... which is
not there earlier in the story), or it is assumed
that it everybody knows there would be a
garden.  Any thoughts on this?
\fac MM-F:  See revised Line.  We discussed with
craftor and this is how he proposed to easily
correct this introduction of the garden.

\con LB2 o.k. Its good you paid attention to the
difficulties people encountered leading to
confusion. This is much simpler now.
\fac MM2:  Yes, they really understood this part now. 
The bottom line in this story and the "Fall" story
came through - God told them not to eat the fruit
of this tree.  They ate the fruit.  They disobeyed
and broke what God told them to do. God
punished them.
\con DP Re your TST2 <Why is there one tree that
the man cannot eat the fruit of?  He will die if he
eats it.  But this is a question that the man (one
of the test group men) asked himself, "Why
would God say he could not eat of that fruit?")
They said that the answer to this question was
not told in this story.  They did not further
comment on what they thought a possible
answer might be.>...
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Very interesting.  Often
when someone in the group poses a question
like this, there is some thought behind it that the
person may not be initially expressing. So a
good response to this is to turn the question
back to that person... <Why do YOU think that
might be?>
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  So, please probe with
another UNS as to <Why is there one tree that
the man cannot eat the fruit of?>, and then if
there is a response like <He will die if he eats
it.>... then probe further with <Why do you think
he would die?>  If the response is just
something like <Maybe it was poisonous.>, then
you should probe further... <Who made the
tree?  Why would he (assuming God) make the
tree poisonous?).
\con DP (CONTINUED...) You probably realize that
what I am getting at here is that with your
omission now of the result of eating the tree
being that it would cause them to know about
many things, including evil, hearers may assume
the story could be implying something
unfortunate about God's nature from this.  Or
with the way it is worded here in the story, it
may not even be clear that this is a prohibition to
test obedience, rather than God just warning
them that one of the trees was poisonous and
should be avoided. The testing should probe
further.
\fac MM3:  Okay.  In further testing, we probed this
question specifically.  Please see updated BT file
for answers.  Based on this response, what do
you feel best for us to adjust within the story?
We had included the specific details about the
two trees and their names. However, this was
confused in testing and people did not
understand the trees, nor did they understand
the names of the trees and how if they ate the
fruit of the tree of "knowing good and knowing
bad" they would become intelligent, like God.
How can we make this information explicit, and
still be anchorable?  Or is this a detail that is
made clearer in the Fall story and you do not
feel it needs to be made explicit?  Thanks for
your suggestions.  I am sure this is not the first
time you have seen issues about the trees arise
in a story set. Any advice, input you have is
welcomed.
\con DP2 I wonder if the earlier version that had the
names of the trees had them too tightly packed
to be reproduced well in retelling. Might it be
learnable if it were unpacked along the lines of
TN, something like <Anyone who eats fruit from
that tree, it causes them to know about
evil/wrongdoing in addition to knowing what is
right/good/correct>
\fac MM4:  We have added this phrase.  See adjusted
BT file.  We will test this phrase on several to
make sure it is understandable and retellable.
\ln 01.12a
\con LB2 o.k. Much clearer, though you  have lost
some good content "knowing good and knowing
bad".
\con DP-F With the restored phrasing <you will know
good and know bad> could you ask a testing
question like <What kinds of things do you think
he might know about that would be "bad"?>
\fac MM-F:  We will test this and report back. 
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) Also, is this the same word
as used for "sin" (kapii) as reported in the L&C
Notes?

like <What kinds of things do you think Adam
would be doing taking care of the garden?>,
then it would be a good question to have here.
\fac MM3:  I can remove this question.  The question
that they are answering is the one you pose
here.  "What do you think Adam will do in the
garden?"  If it literally was asked "What wll
Adama" do?"  They would have answered, "I
don't know.  Only God knows."  I have deleted
this question, and will make future questions
more explicit.
\con DP2 Ok, since it does seem to answer a <what

\con LB re <God noticed..> it would be good to
determine whether "he noticed" might imply God
wasn't aware of it previously. Could you say
something like. "God had not made a helper for
him.  And he said, it is not good for Adam to be
alone."
\fac MM:  The actual translation says that "God saw"
that it is not good for Adam to be alone.  This
implies that God knew it wasn't good for Adam to
be alone.  This reinforces God's all-knowing and
loving/caring provision. It does not seem to be 
inaccurate in the way it is stated.
\con LB1 I gather from your comments that rather
than God discovering something new about
Adam's condition, it is understood rather as God
knowing. That would be alright then.
\fac MM1:  Yes, this is true.  However, for this
particular line, we will go ahead and adjust to
better match scripture and use a direct
quotation.  See adjusted BT.
\con LB2 Could you please put the MM comment into
the BT file as a crafting note. That way when
others see that documentation in the future the
same question I had won't come to them.

"MM" comment no longer applies as the crafted
story text changed.

\con LB2 re<a helper who's going to be himself>
Have you been able to test this with others?
Could you ask a tst question here like, "how do
you think a helper could be himself?" or "what
kind of helper would be himself?" or something
along that line.
\fac MM2:  See test question.  From our testing
session it appears that this is understood.
However, language barriers made it difficult to
discuss and get more info out of it.  If it is just
added information, I could delete that part of the
line.  A similar thought is included in line 17 -
"This is one of me."
\con DP It seems to be ok, from what you indicate
from the BTer and testing, so I wouldn't suggest
omitting.  I do have a couple of further points
arising from the discussion above and testing:
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Is this phrase <who's going
to be himself> the same as in the Supyire
Genesis draft?
\fac MM3:  No, I cannot read this sentence exactly in
the Supyire draft.  It reads, "Å‹gemu u sÃ­ n-yaa
nÃ¡ u e ke.Â» " which appears to say "who's fitting
to him."  But I'm not as familiar with the terms in
this sentence.  We further probed a bit on this
question as well and got an example given to us
for this phrase.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) When you say <comme lui
in French>, does this mean that your testing
questions and/or responses are being given in
French rather than Supyire?
\fac MM3:  No, as mentioned above, this was one
case in which we were testing the story with a
woman friend of ours who runs a local boutique. 
It is somewhat like a "bus-stop" in which
travellers come and go. A gentlemen who was
listening to the story chimed in to "help us"
understand and give input into the meaning of
this Supyire phrase.  He used the French phrase
here to expound upon the Supyire phrase's
meaning.  Testing is done in Supyire. Unless
noted otherwise or phrases tried to be explained
by using other languages.
\con DP2 Ok, the testing shows good comprehension,
and it seems like it might be a very natural way
of expressing the concept.  What I would suggest
doing is when you address the final issues in this
story with the crafter, bring to his attention the
fact that the wording in the story on this point is
different from the wording in the Supyire
Genesis draft, and ask him if he perceives any
difference.  You might also discuss this one with
the person from the translation team who is
reviewing the story set, and ask him how he/she
sees the difference between the two, and if
appropriate, why they chose the "fitting to him"
expression.
\fac MM4:  Based on retellings and on the differences
in the Supyire draft and the craftor's choice of
words, we have revised this line to match that of
the draft.
\con DP3 OK
\con DP-F Regarding the new wording <fitting for
him>, could you ask a testing question of
someone who has not heard this wording before,
something like <When someone is "fitting" for
you, how would you describe that person?  In
what ways might they be "fitting"?>
\fac MM-F:  Will test and report back.

\con LB2 Re <put them above the animals>... this
would be worth a testing question to ascertain
that this isn't being taken literally. Something
like <Why do you think God put them above the
animals? In what ways do you think people are
above animals?>
\fac MM2:  See testing question related to this.  This
terminology is repeated in "the Fall" story as the
woman wants to be "above" the man, but God
has now placed the man on top (above) her.
They explained at one time that it means to be
the boss of or to have "dominion" over.
\con DP Ok, the testing shows this to be good.  But in
order not to model the "What does x mean?"
kinds of questions, could I ask you to change the
beginning of the tst line that says <What does it
mean to be "above" the animals?  It's like how

\con DP The current content of line 20 is best divided
into three lines, which you could number 20a,
20b, 20c.  It is difficult both for you and the
consultant to evaluate the proper anchorability of
the story when there is this much content in a
single line.  So for the first bit <It was good in
the garden>, what is your anchor for this part?
And so on.
\fac MM3:  Okay, this line has been broken up and
anchored.  .
\con DP-F ok

\con DP Re <There was a good alliance [MM:
relationship] between the man and woman and
God.  God spoke with them in the garden and
walked with them in the garden.>  There may be
some who have access to this story and
documentation in the future who may question
the biblical accuracy of this point. Your crafting
note <We expanded this line....> is in indication
that you are aware that this is an amplification of
what the biblical text says at this point.  Any time
there is this sort of amplification, it is best to
give the exegetical support for it (e.g. from one
of the helps or commentaries in TW)....
\con DP (CONTINUED...) For example, for the notion
of God customarily walking in the garden, the
following support can be given <Hamilton
Commentary on Genesis 3:8 in TW says "The
verb used here to describe the divine
movement...suggests iterative and habitual
aspects. Such walks would take place in the
early evening.">
\con DP (CONTINUED...) As for the nature their being
an "alliance" or "good relationship" between God
and the man & woman prior to the fall, that
needs some sort of exegetical support as well. 
It can come from the commentary on some
other part of scripture, if you might find that.  I
haven't yet located something of that nature. So
it may not be supportable. The fact that in the
testing of retelling, people did not include this
line may be an indication that the way it was
expressed is not very natural, or too abstract. 
That may be indicative that you do not need to
include it.
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  Recall that a basic concept
of storying is that primary oral communicators
may internalize the abstract or analytical
concepts not by having them made explicit, (e.g.
a good relationship) but by the concrete
narrative events that communicate them (e.g.
walking in the garden).
\fac MM3:  See additional anchoring.  
\con DP2 Nice exegetical support for the relationship
component.  OK.

\con DP Re the crafting note <The way the word is
used it means that the snake is tricky, but the
word used in the draft can also mean smart or

should be identified as to the source.  For
example, if the storycrafter gave you this
information it has a very different value than if a
testing respondent or UNS backtranslator said it. 
Information like this coming from the
storycrafter is sometimes helpful.  But the
storycrafter will be saying what he thinks or
hopes is being communicated, while a testing
respondent (true UNS) will be more reliably
communicating how the core receptor
community is interpreting the story.
\fac kh3:  The term used in the Supyire Gen draft is
the same term used in the story, "cyiige" which
can mean to be clever, smart, or intelligent. Our
crafter did assure us that this could also mean
"crafty"; and this has been affirmed with our
backtranslator, BK as well as through testing and
further probing (see keyterm list for examples).

what they could eat, but said, "The snake went

she could eat." However, because the remainder
of the dialogue between the woman & snake was
told well, and this was told in previous retellings,
the direct dialogue will be maintained here.  He
is using the same terms we use in the story.>...
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) I am in agreement with you
that simplifying this to what the testing
respondent said would not be so good.  But I'd
urge you to be hesitant about what you recall of
previous retellings for which you don't have
recordings to verify. Do you have recordings of
any of the previous retellings? If not, I'd urge
you to test this again with another person doing
the retelling.  Record it and report what the
person says for this part.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) What does the Supyire
Genesis draft say for this verse?
\fac MM:  The draft states, "Is it true that God said
you can not eat of all the fruit of the trees?
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...)  I raise this concern here
because the wording in the story may not be
clear enough at this point that the snake was
trying to trick her, casting doubt on what God
had said... e.g. <Did God REALLY say...?> or <Is
it really true that God said....?> Compared to
these the form of the question in the story <Did
God ask you not to eat the fruit of all the trees?>
seems kind of innocuous, and may be part of
what led the reteller to say it in seemingly even
more innocuous terms still... <...asked her what
she could eat.>
\fac MM:  We will retest and have another retelling to
make sure this is clear.
\fac MM:  In retesting again, he left out the phrase
"Did God ask you, but stated, "Can you eat ...".
In retesting, it still appears unclear that the
snake is trying to trick her. But rather the snake
has told her these things and knows this because
the snake is "smart" or "cunning".  I wonder if
because of the multiple meanings the Supyire
word "cunning" has, if it is being misconstrued
and putting too much weight/emphasis on the
snake's intelligence. Could it also be made
explicit, in line 02, "One day, the snake went to
the woman, wanting to trick her, and said to the
woman,  ...."  Line 02 can be restated to match
draft.  "Is it true that God said you can not eat of
all the fruit of the trees?"  In making it explicit
that the snake is trying to "trick" her, the
meaning of "cunning" here in line 01a should be
very clear. We could also add an introduction
here, "After God created the world, the man and
woman were living in the garden."

and particularly in light of the rewording of the
initial line by a testing respondent in the retelling
testing <They have said, these things are true>,
it would be worth pursuing this sort of response
with a follow up question like <Do you think this
story is true?  Why / Why not?>

\con DP Re <Tst2:  How did the snake know they
would not die?  Because he was made more
intelligent than all the other animals>... this is a
great testing question.  It begs for a followup
question something like <So why do you think
God told them they would die if they ate it?>
\fac kh3:  This is another area that we talked about,
he told us that God made the entire garden for
the man & woman to eat from, that this one tree
was God's tree alone and he asked them not to
eat of it b/c it was God's tree.  We asked him
why God would make a tree that could do this,
killing a person, and he told us how there are
many trees, all trees are good trees but some of
them are poisionous and you cannot eat from
them, but they are not bad trees.  Just like God
made this tree his tree and did not want them to
eat of it, and He told them they would die.
\con DP2 I'm assuming this follow up discussion you
report in kh3 immediately above was based on
the earlier version of story 01 which didn't have
the part now added about <If you eat the fruit of
that tree, you will know good and know bad.>. 
What you report above still seems to have a
focus on God simply warning them away from a
poisonous tree.  Now that you have a revised
Story 1, please re-test this story (or any revision
you make of it based on the other consultant
notes here).  Play Story 1 first, and then go on
to test Story 2.  Test again with this question
<How did the snake know they would not die?>,
and do appropriate follow up questions if needed.
\fac MM:  Okay.  Retested.  See updated BT.  
\con DP-F3 ok
\p
\con DP2 Re <You will not die>, note that this was not
repeated in the retelling from testing. This notion
of the snake directly contradicting what God had
said seems to be a significant omission in the
retelling from what is in the original story.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) I'm not suggesting that you
simplify the story to be like what the reteller had
at this point.  I would suggest that in a second
testing of retelling that you note whether this
makes it into the retelling or not. If not, there
may be something you need to talk with your
crafter about trying to make this part more
salient in the way the story is told.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...), note that in the Display of
TN for this verse there are several alternate
renderings that try to make this salient. <NO,
you certainly will not die> or <No that's not true,
you won't die> or <No, he lies, you will not die>.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) What does the Supyire
Genesis draft have for this?  (Please be aware
that whenever I ask this question it is not merely
to try to nudge you to have the story say it
exactly like the translation draft has it. I'm both
wanting you to explore ideas, and for myself to
try to be aware of where the story wordings
might have come from.  Where the story is
legitimately different from the translation draft, I
need to make sure we are on solid ground with
having the variance on oral vs written style.)
\fac MM:  The draft states here, "That's not true.  You
will not die." This line was restated in the retest. 
Performance error is likely in the first round, as
this was the first session with this testor.

That's ok. You don't necessarily need a separate
L&C Note entry for <intelligent), so perhaps just
delete <see keyterms> from this note.
\con DP2 Or are you saying that the word
<intelligent> here in this line of the story is the
same word as backtranslated as <cunning> up
in line 02a?  Does the Supyire Genesis draft
have the same expression for cunning / shrewd
in Gen.03:01 as for wise in Gen.03:06?
\fac MM:  No, these are two separate, distinct words, 
both in the story and in the draft. Reference "see
keyterms" has been deleted from the line.
However, if there appears to be too much
emphasis on the "intelligence" of the snake, line
01a could be deleted.  If the snake wanting to
"trick" the woman, can be made explicit, then the
meaning behind the "cunning" word should
become clearer.

the story.
\con LB1 o.k.
\p
\con DP Re <Tst2:  How could eating beautiful fruit
make you more intelligent?  because it was from
God's tree.>... With a response like this it would
be worth asking follow up questions that probed
the significance of why this respondent thought
this was <God's tree>.  You would mainly want
to be making sure that there wasn't some
element being inferred that God was somehow
being "stingy".
\fac kh3:  No, our guard friend told us God had
created the entire garden full of food for them
that they could eat, but there was just one tree
that they could not eat of, that was God's. Based
on the statement that God gave them an entire
garden to eat from, stinginess is not being
communicated.
\con DP2 Your above statement is indicative of the
kind of inferences or broad interpretations
you've frequently been making throughout the
crafting notes and con note responses -- of what
you think / feel / believe to be what is being
communicated or what people are inferring.
(There is no "think / feel / believe" in this
particularly wording, of course, but the passive
"...is not being communicated" is circumlocuting
toward the same function).
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) From the experience of
those of us who've worked many years on
language and culture issues with oral
communicators from different cultures than our
own, I'd urge you to do the testing that we ask
of you, and avoid making these leaps of
interpretation as your responses. Focus more
closely on what people are saying in response to
specific questions, and to the way they retell a
story, rather than bringing your own interpretive
reasoning into the responses.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...)  You and I might reason
somewhat abstractly that if God made lot's of
good things for Adam and Eve to eat (from a
different part of the story), that Him having one
tree that was His own wouldn't be interpreted as
stingy.  Someone from a different cultural
background may not have the same inference.
That is precisely what we are trying to find out
with the testing.  I ask these questions because
some specific experiences somewhere else have
shown this to be a potential issue.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Please don't take me as

think the wording would mean God was stingy by
saying this.  I don't know.  You may well be right

be implying that. Let's find out.

\con LB Re: <She picked up one and gave one to her

(Translator's Notes): <It is not clear from the
Hebrew text here whether she took several
pieces of fruit or only one. If you must choose in
your translation, it is recommended that you use
the plural form.> How does this agree with S.
Genesis?
\fac KH: from my understanding the Supyrie draft
uses the plural form but this will be changed. See
change in BT.
\con DP2 Note that in the testing of retelling this part
is backtranslated as <cut and ate it one and told
the man "come and have one">. This sounds like
the reteller here understood this still to be one,
single fruit. If the Supyire draft has it clearly as
plural, you wouldn't want the story to seem
different on this sort of thing.

plural.  In further retest, he matches that of
original story and is plural.

different -- <picked up>, possibly problematic as
well, so I can understand you having changed it.)

\con DP Re tst <How did they know they were
naked?  Because they ate the fruit God told them
not to and then they knew that their clothes were
lost to them>... it would be good in a situation
like this to probe further on the part of the
response that said <...they knew that their
clothes were lost to them>. It may be ok, if
<lost to them> is just the normal way in Supyire
of expressing that they didn't have any clothes /
weren't wearing clothes.  But if it implies that
they did have them, but they had been lost, then
some adjustment may be needed.
\fac kh3:  What we use in the story is the same that
is used in the Supyire Gen draft, in our
conversation he explained that it was as if it was
a realization that they were uncovered. The
phrase is a cultural way to express they didn't
have any clothes.
\con DP2 This could be a case where the Supyire Gen
draft (or the story) is not so explicit on this
particular point, enough to avoid unfortunate
inferences -- i.e. leaves open the possibility of
different interpretations. That's ok for written
translation, but not so for reproducible storying.
Note that the retelling backtranslation has <they
came naked... without clothes>.  This is not
clear, but it still sounds like the inference may be
that they must have been wearing clothes, but
upon eating the fruit they suddenly realized they
weren't wearing any.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Re your kh3 comment
above <...in our conversation he explained that
it was as if it was a realization that they were
uncovered>... is this something you are
remembering from the testing session (with the
retelling) from 19Aug (some 10 days earlier).  I
would generally not rely on my recollections of
what happened from interaction in another
language, and with that sort of time elapsing. Do
you have a recording of this?  Or notes that
include this point?
\fac MM:  These were based on notes taken and
written at a testing session.  While not all
previous testing sessions were recorded,
handwritten notes were taken and comments are
based on these notes; not on memory. This
comment is based on a note.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Again, please do not take
me as saying that I believe the testing
respondent to have inferred that they definitely
were clothed. I don't know. I am simply trying to
guide you to a process where you evaluate more
closely the details of the testing responses to
questions and the retellings, and not try to justify
something from your memory or your own
interpretation, but indicate responses for which
you have solid (recent, recorded) indications.

here that I had been thinking might resolve itself
in your further attention to the story and possible
revision.  But the wording is still there so I'll
raise it.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...)  Re <Then God called the
man.  He answered and God asked him, â€œWhere
are you?â€> and the crafting note <In the Supyire
culture, to answer someone's call for you may
not be an actual word, but more of a grunt or a
"hmmmm.">... I'm wondering if this means that
the sequence envisioned here is (a) Adam and
Eve hear God and hide; (b) God calls, like
"Adam....".  (c) Adam responds with something
like "hmmm".  (d)  God hears that and knows
that they are around somewhere, but doesn't
know exactly where, so asks "Where (exactly)
are you?".
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) As far as I am aware there
is no indication in the text or other exegetical
support of this intermediate part of the sequence
where God hears the man's muted response and
this causes him to ask more specifically where
Adam is.  In fact, if that is the sequence that is
envisioned here, it may be an erosion to the
concept of God being all knowing.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED)  Could you tell me -- How
does the Supyire Genesis draft have this
sequence in Gen.03:09?
\fac MM:  The Supyire draft states, "God called the
man, 'Where are you?'".  We can remove the
part where it states "He answered and God
asked him...".  Question though, could it also not
be inferred from the English translations of text
that if God must ask "Where are you?" , that in
itself is an erosion to the concept of God being
all knowing?  We will remove the intermediaries.
\con DP-F3 Responding here to your comment above
<Question though, could it also not be inferred
from the English translations of text that if God
must ask "Where are you?" , that in itself is an
erosion to the concept of God being all
knowing?>... Yes, if the readers in English are
taking this question not in some rhetorical sense,
it would be eroding the concept.  And that is the
problem with literal translation, particular when
dealing with rhetorical questions. And it is why I
was pressing the point in testing as to whether
these questions being asked by God were being
taken as true requests for information about
which God was somehow ignorant, versus
rhetorical -- i.e. said for some other purpose.
\con DP-F3 (CONTINUED...) TH makes this clear by
saying about the first question (Where are
you?)... <In some languages there is an
idiomatic form for this question, which people
always use when they arrive at a house or
settlement and call out for a person there.> And
TN suggests for the second question (Who told
you that you were naked?)... <In some
languages it may be better to express the
second question by a statement, for example:....
I see you have eaten the fruit of the tree that I
commanded you not to eat. -OR- It must be that
you have eaten the fruit of the tree I
commanded you not to eat.>
\fac MM-F2 - Ok.  This is a typical expression used
when someone arrives at another's house. Even

oftentimes this phrase is asked.

\con LB re < "Iâ€™m going to curse the snake, which is
going to crawl during all its life and is going to
eat the mud"  It is interesting that line 15 has
God talking about the snake "Iâ€™m going to curse
the snake, which is going to crawl during all its
life and is going to eat the mud", and then
suddenly in line 16 he is talking to the snake
""Iâ€™m going to put nastiness between you and the
woman."  Your testing note "It was understood
clearly that God was talking to the snake here" is
very good -- shows that you were aware of the
story not introducing who was saying this.  It
would be good for you to compare some of the
natural, non-biblical stories you are collecting to
see if this sort of switching is common, or
whether it might be a possibly unnatural effect of
the storyteller improvising on the spot as she/he
was trying to remember the details of the story,
and not yet having it in a fluid form.
\fac KH:  Is this wrong?  It is understood who God is
speaking to, even with the changes. Can this
wait until the final recording to be changed/
talked about?
\con LB 1 You could leave it, since you have tested it
already and it is understood. But as you said, if
you get to the final stage, you might look into it
again. Here is a suggestion; something like
"Then God said to the snake: "because of what
you have done, a curse is on you, which is that
you will crawl during all of your  life and you will
eat mud" That way it is God speaking already to
the snake. It is also saying that a curse
\fac kh1: ok, this has been changed.  See BT
\con LB Re: <curse> could you please add an entry
for this in the Keyterm notes?
\fac KH: "curse" has been added to the keyterms
\con LB1 re <curse update> I don't seem to have the
updated key term list. Let me just ask a question
about "curse". Could you ask if "curse" always
involves magic? If it does, you may want to
consider saying something like "punish" rather
than curse. It would then sound like, "because of
what you have done/because you tricked the
woman, you will be punished..."
\fac kh1:  curse does not always involve magic here,
it does often but we have been given many
times when it does not.  For example, a mother
telling her child that he is not smart and that his
school will be broken, or a father tellling his son
he is a bad worker/ uncapable.  These are both
examples we have been given in our home
village when asking about the term for curse. It
is like willing something bad to happen to a
person.  I think for this story using curse is well
understood.

part of the curse about the woman having
difficult childbirth & her desire to be on top of her
man, basically all of 02.17.  It is interesting here,
that as a male, he does not retell parts of the
curse on the woman very well, but does get
every detail of the curse on the man.  Our
female friends who have heard the story, have
retold every bit of this curse on the woman, but
omitted portions of the curse on the man.  Based
on the fact that it seems different parts of the
curse has more personal importance/meaning
than others, it will be left in as is.>...
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Individuals need to be able
to retell a story without significant omissions or
distortions in order for stories to be orally
reproducible.  If no one has demonstrated that
they can tell the story so as to include both the
punishments then this would be indicating that
you probably do not have an orally reproducible
story.  
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) There would seem to be
three possibilities for you to address this at this
point:
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) (a) If you think that the
story IS orally reproducible in its entirety as it
currently stands (and could include the detail
even for this particular part of the story), then
you would need to have someone listening to the
story enough times without getting frustrated,
and then you do something equivalent to the
exercises done in a storying group (I'm referring
to the exercises that get the entire group to
orally learn the story).  Then audio-record ONE
person retelling the entire story. Backtranslate
that (or have it backtranslated) and send those
results to me that show how someone is able to
retell the entire story in a way that includes the
details for these particular lines that have been
missed previously.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Or (b) Simplify the story so
that it does not include so much of the
difficult-to-reproduce part about the
punishments.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Or (c) Do something to
make the difficult-to-reproduce parts more
salient.  This can include some things like: (1)
getting the storycrafter to reword those parts in
a way that makes them more salient or
emphatic; (2) giving attention to whether the
expressions really are as natural as they might
need to be to enhance reproducibility, and
getting the storycrafter to reword as
appropriate; (3) making sure that when this part
of the story is told by the storycrafter that the
intonation / voice gives it emphasis or
prominence; (4) working on a song that would
be an integral part of the storying session as
accompanying the story every time it is told, as
a way of reinforcing the difficult-to-reproduce
parts.
\fac MM:  See comments from retest in BT file.

\con LB Re: <Almighty> thanks for added Keyterm
note
\fac KH: no problem!
\con DP Now that we are doing a final read-through
for things like cohesion, the consistent use of
key terms will be more in focus.  LB has asked
questions elsewhere about the use of God and
Lord, and I'd like to now follow up on this in
greater detail. 
\con DP (CONTINUED...) It is fine for a story set to
"level out" these terms, and just use something
like "God" throughout the story, regardless of
whether the source passage is differentiating,
say between "God" versus "Lord" versus "Lord
God" as in this chapter of Genesis.  However, if a
decision is made in a particular panorama to
distinguish these names for God, then the use of
the terms shouldn't be random in the stories.
Instead, they should be used as the anchor for
any particular bit of the story that uses them.
\con DP (CONTINUED)...  Note for example that in
this Genesis 3 passage, the narrator always uses
Lord God, but when the snake is speaking, he
just uses God.  This could be significant, so your
story shouldn't just randomly vary between God
and Lord God in this story.  Let's talk about this
more when we are on skype.  If you stay with a
differentiation of these terms, then you will need
to do a consistent pass throughout the story set
as to what the source passages use. I'd rather
see this done before you send the stories to me
now in the one-by-one pass we are now doing.
\fac kh3:  Correct, there are various ways God, the
Lord, and the Lord God are addressed and used
in out story set.  After disscussing which term we
believe would help the Supyire to have a greater
understanding and to help bridge the gap that
other terms may create the God of who we are
talking about in our stories we will consistently
use the term "God", and only "God" in our story
set, where, both "Lord" and "Lord God" have
been used.  Since this is a major keyterm can
this be addressed in final recordings, with the
approperiate notes, annotitations, and reminders
set in place until that time? As for our New
Testament stories where the term "Lord" is used
in reference to Jesus we will also simipifly and
use the term "Jesus" throughout.  So throughout
our story set we have will have "God" and
"Jesus" .  This is a good choice to help simpifily
& clarify and prevent any misunderstandings of
whom the story is referring to.
\con DP2 Regarding your question above <...can this
be addressed in final recordings, with the
approperiate notes, annotitations, and reminders
set in place until that time?>... Yes. Please try to
make the adjustments as you go through this
current pass of the stories you are on.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Also, please include in your
entry for <God> in the L&C Notes some of the
discussion above that you are using the single
term <Kile> where the source passages have
things like <Lord> or <Lord God>.
\fac MM:  Okay.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Regarding the use of
<Lord> with Jesus in the NT stories, if it is used
in places where the passage that anchors the
story line has <Lord>, it would be fine to keep it
there.  That is a bit different issue than the
names of God.

\con DP2 Re [Why?] and the jump to the entry in the

Because of this, I'd suggest you modify the \r
line in that L&C note, to just be [Why?], and
modify the description so that it covers both
[Why? Because] and only [Why?]
\con DP2 Since you have a number of entries in your
L&C notes that are multi word like this, and
some of them wouldn't be clear to those who will
access the files that they would have L&C Notes
for them, I will suggest that you mark your live
jumps in the BT line in some special way that will
make it obvious that there is a live jump to the
L&C Notes.  For example, perhaps use curly
brackets, and have the line look something like
this < {Why?}  They ate the... >.  Then you can
place a note among your abbreviation key in the
00 file that explains what the {...} curly brackets
are indicating.

\con DP-F3 Re <chased> in the phrase <God chased
the man and the woman out of the garden>...,
note that the retelling has the backtranslation
<kicked out>, as also does the next story
04:02.  But then 06:03 again uses <chased>,
while the retelling at that part has <made them
leave>.   And in 32:03 <chase> is used of Jesus
casting out / driving away evil spirit. The
retelling at this point says <casting out>.  From
that 32:03 story (and the response to the testing
questions there), I'm taking it that <chase> in
Supyire is naturally used in a figurative way. 
I.e. not as literally <chasing>, but causing to go
away, even by word.  Similar to how <kicked
out> in English doesn't literally involve
<kicking>.  So I don't necessarily see it as
problematic.  But I'm curious now about the
variation between <chase> and <kick>,
particularly about the fact that none of the
retellings seem to use <chase> (unless the bt of
the retelling isn't so precise on this point.)  I
guess my main thing is just to make sure there's
not some issue with <chase>  that made the
retellers all shy away from it.
\fac MM-F2:  Here, the same word is used in each
instance.  Our backtranslator sometimes says
"chased", sometimes "kicked out".  It does not
have to literally mean "chasing", but can mean
"to make something leave".  This is the word
used in the Supyire draft for this verse.  I will
include this comment in the BT.

\con DP2 Re <broken> in the phrase <the
relationship between them and God was
broken>... Can you tell me why this line was
changed from the previous wording of <the
relationship between them and God became
hard>?  Note that in the retelling testing the
reteller said <And their betweens and them to
God's between became hard>.
\fac MM:  Please see comments and discussions of
relationships in Abraham ConNote file. This was
the reason behind this change - to keep things
cohesive through the story set. Based on
researching how relationships are "good",
"broken/cut", and "put back together"; the
wording of the sentence will/has changed
throughout the stories.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Note also in the retelling
that earlier in the story (around line 16) where
the story has <put nastiness between you and
the woman>... the retelling in testing retold this
as <The betweens of the woman and snake is
hard> and <The betweens of the woman's
children & the snakes children is hard>.  This
makes it seem like <betweens becoming hard>
might be the more natural expression for what
happens when relationships go bad.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) My concern in this line of
questioning is to interact with you about whether
the figurative analogy of a "breaking" a
"relationship" is one that you may have
introduced, versus one that is a deeper, existing
way of expressing things in Supyire.  If it's one
you've introduced, then it may be difficult to see
it reproduced in retellings.  Yet it is important
because the "relationship" theme is built around
it.  Might it be that the reteller expressing it
consistently as <becoming hard> is the more
natural way of talking about what happens when
a relationship goes bad?
\fac MM:  Again, see discussions and research done
on relationships in Abraham ConNote file.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Your entry for
<relationship> now in the L&C Notes very nicely
spells out how the "betweens being good"
functions in traditional Supyire culture, and
nicely gives examples from the Supyire NT about
it's use.  (Very nice work!)
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) It is equally important now
to fill out (probably in other entries) what the
traditional way of expressing it in Supyire when
the relationship goes bad. Is it best expressed as
<their betweens become hard>?  If so then this
is the expression that should be used throughout
the story set. (And I'd like to see some indication
of whether this expression is used in the Supyire
NT translation.)
\fac MM:  See updated L&C Notes.  
\con DP-F3 ok
\fac
\con DP2  Similarly important is how the fixing of a
relationship (reconciliation) is expressed in
traditional Supyire thought.  And again, how is
this reflected in the Supyire NT translation?  As
we continue to discuss the outworking of the
Relationship theme, you should work more on
this.
\fac MM:  Updated L&C Notes.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) One final thing about
<Then the relationship between them and God
was broken.>... The exegetical support you've
given here on the anc line justifies the
<relationship> part of this as in story 01 line
20b, but something more is needed to support
the the notion that the relationship was
<broken> or <became hard>.  I would suggest
that Rom.05:10-15 actually serves as the better
anchor for this line.  To simplify your
documentation for this line, then, omit the
lengthy repetition of the anchor that is the same
as what is in story 01 line 20b, and for the
anchor here, just say <Rom.05:10 -15, for
"relationship" see also the anchor for story 01
line 20b>

\con LB Re: <useless> Could you expand on the word
used in the S. Genesis
\fac MM  We took this sentence and re
back-translated it very slowly and inquired more
into its meaning.  We received a more indepth
explanation as follows, "Then God said, â€œIâ€™m
going to destroy the world.  Why? Because I tire
myself (itâ€™s worthless) in creating the world.   It
was better not to have created the world, than to
create it.â€ This is a literal/concrete way of saying
God "regretted" making the world and was
"offended" by it.  Is this acceptable?   I will
update the BT.
\con LB1 Somehow I still think about it and wonder
what the Supyire Genesis translation used for
this. Could you check it still? - The answer to
your test question indicates that it is understood
that the reason for God wanting to destroy the
world was that people were doing bad. Also, that
the gist of it is regret. That would be alright. I
think what I wonder still is, if the main feeling
here is that God was frustrated or as it indicated
in Gen06:6b were "He was grieved to His heart." 
You could add at the end of 15.05 something like
"and it grieved him a lot" to make that clearer.
\fac MM1:  In review the Supyire text and in speaking
with our crafter, the expression of "regret' or the
fact that God is "sorry" that He made creation is
clear here - both stated in Supyire text and in
the story.  However, there is a line in Supyire
text, as you pointed out Gen 6:06b, that states,
"God's face was sour". Basically expression the
emotion of sadness and grief.  We will include
this. See revised BT -added before line 06.

provide a "lid" for the boat.
\con DP Re the two testing respondents imagining that
God "put a lid" on the boat, or perhaps even
(TST5) that God had made the lid (is that how
you interpret the testing respondent's "He" in
"God can close it.  He closed the boat.  He made
a lid.  It was a big lid."?) ... this may be an
indication that simplification in the story of not
including the fact that God had told Nu to make a
roof, and a door in the side of it, that it seems to
be leading to some sort of misunderstanding
about what the "closing" was about.   /// Is the
expression here <God closed the canoe> the
same wording as in the Supyire Genesis draft?
\fac MM3:  The Supyire draft states that the Lord,
"closed the opening". (here the word opening
could mean a generic opening or hole or could
also mean doorway).   We can adjust this to
say."God closed the boats' opening". It's

did not follow up on that comment from you, but
would seem to need some follow up. First, it
appears that you have changed <creatures> to
<insects> in the backtranslation without any
trace.  If you modify the original backtranslation
you should use brackets to indicate this sort of
change. So something like <All the creatures
[MM "insects" based on input from another
person], animals....>.  I'm not real clear on what
was done since as I can't trace it from this   The
second issue to be followed up on is the
ambiguity of the response <The actual word he
used here in the story, translates into "insects".>
Does <he> refer to the crafter or to the SIL
translator?  If the latter, it is confusing when you
say <...in the story> rather than <...in the draft
of Genesis>.  If it is the former (i.e. the crafter),
then I don't see how it relates to my question.
Could you please clarify.
\fac MM2:  The word our craftor has used here is
"insects", not "creatures".  Our backtranslator
clarified it for us and so I changed it in the BT. I
apologize for not noting the change better.
However, since our crafter has used the word
"insects" and there is no mention of the word
"creature"; I did not comment on the meaning of
the word creature because it's no longer in the
text.  I don't know the Supyire word for
"creature" or if there is one.  The word "insect"
basically corresponds to our English word for
insects.
\con LB Re: <creature> Could you please tell the
meaning of the word used in S. Genesis.
\fac MM  The actual word he used here in the story,
translates into "insects".
\con DP What LB and I were trying to get at by the
above line of questions (they originated with me)
was that is seems a bit odd for the story to talk
about insects and animals, unless this description
in Supyire is the way of specifying the categories
of all animal life on earth. For example in line 25
it talks about <animals and birds> where the
anchor doesn't mention <birds>. So <insects
and animal> doesn't seem to be the regular
expression of all categories of animal.  Could
you specify whether <insects, animals, and
human beings> is what is used as the categories
in the Supyire Genesis draft for the anchor
verses here of <gen.07:21 - 22>? Thanks.
\fac MM3:  In the Supyire draft, it states that "All the
breathing things that were on earth... birds,
animals, bush animals, and crawling things..."
The word here for "crawling things" include
insects, bugs, snakes, all things that crawl or
creep on the ground. The word our crafter uses
here seems to also be generic and literally
translates "earth walkers".  To make sure all
categories of breathing things on earth are
covered, we will reword this sentence as it is
stated in the draft.

\con LB2 re<they praised God> I appreciate your

to be a well-understood practice in S culture. 
Please include in a note in your BT file some
comments on why the story generalizes sacrifice
here to <they praised God>, but retains the
specific notion of sacrifice in other places.
\fac MM2:  In this particular story, to use the word
sacrifice, a word with much baggage, we feel
would distract from the point of the story - God
being seen as Provider, All Powerful, desiring us
to follow Him and have relationship with Him.  It
is less distracting and simpler to use a generic
term of "praise" than to use the word for
sacrifice here.  In testing the original version
with the word "sacrifice" in it, it brought up some
questions as to what exactly Noah was doing. 
Was he cutting the throats of chicken into a
bowl? Was he putting some sort of offering in the
road?  Was he bringing milk to the elders?  I
believe the only place the word sacrifice is used
is in the Elijah story, where details of the
sacrifice are explained and to whom the sacrifice
is made and why is clear. Because of the detail
in this story to the actual sacrifice made, it was
decided to leave the word "sacrifice" in.
\con LB1 re<they praised God> I notice you
eliminated that Nu made a sacrifice to God.
Would this not be a good thing to keep to show
that Nu actually was sacrificing to God?

baggage it carries. We decided it best to go

a covenant - a signed agreement between two
parties.  It is stronger than just a promise like, "I

"alliance" would be that of a signed agreement

the last part of it, the literal expression for
rainbox meaning <God's machete>, this is good
information to give in a crafting note like this. It
would be worth asking if there is a story behind
this name -- why is it called God's machete?  The
reason for pursuing this would be to determine
whether there may be significant interference
from a traditional concept that could be affecting
how this is understood.  Or conversely whether
there is some bridge or analogy that is useful.
\fac MM3:  Okay.  BT file has been adjusted.  I will
further probe about the meaning and explanation
for the word rainbow.  In discussing this with our
craftor, he stated that he did not know of any
ancient story or traditional story that would
explain why it is called that.  When asked why it
is called that, he said that is it's name. 
Everybody knows the word for it.  And it is called
that because when everyone sees it, they know
that when it comes, rain comes.

say, regarding where the name comes from.  If

\con DP Re <broke> in the phrase <that alliance [KH:
relationship] between broke down>..., this is one
of the few places where this word <broke /
break> is used in the stories themselves, and I
don't find it much in the testing responses. It is
mainly used in your own comments about the
theme of relationship. It is a figure of speech.
\fac MM:  See above comments from SIL.  The actual
translation of BT does use a different word here
than what the SIL translator suggested and from
what our most recent testor retold it as.  We will
modify this.
\con DP (CONTINUED)... So the question arises as to
whether it is a natural way to talk in Supyire
about what happens when a relationship goes
bad.  In other words, you need now to try to
gauge whether this term may have found its way
into the stories from your discussions with the
crafter and trying to explain things to him,
versus it possibly being a natural and
communicative way of expresing things what
happens when relationships go bad in Supyire.
\con DP (CONTINUED)... I'd suggest that you talk to
several people (at least three) with general
questions like:  <Can you tell me about a
situation you know about when two people (or
two groups) originally had a relationship between
them (using the <"woo nyar .. schwoo" (the
relations between us), or "schwoongy"
(betweens)> expression). But then something
happened.  And after that they did NOT have
relationship (again, using the <"woo nyar ..
schwoo" (the relations between us), or
"schwoongy" (betweens)> expressions).  Tell me
about it. Tell me what happened.>
\con DP (CONTINUED)... Record the responses and
go through them carefully, paying attention to
how they talk about the "breaking" of the
relationship in their description.  Particularly see
whether the word being translated in this line as
<broke down> is spontaneously used in those
sorts of descriptions, without your suggesting it
or using it yourselves.
\fac MM:  In asking this of one person, they
responded that in a situation where he came to
someone for help, if they agreed and helped him
and they worked together, then they had a
"good relationship" and it stayed like that.
However, if the person refused to help him, then
the relationship was broken. In this case, he
used the  word "cut" (not the current expression
in this story, but the one used in the tst4
retelling).
\fac MM (CONT):  In another case, our woman friend
simply described the "good relationship" as she
and I had a good relationship because I could
come to her shop, call on her, and we could
work together.  If our relationship was "difficult",
we would not be working together now (she used
the word for "hard"/"difficult".)
\fac MM (Cont): A woman friend in the village
described it.  "When you and your language
helper work together, you have a relationship. If
when you and your language helper are working
together, he refuses to work with you and you
do not read together or study together, the
relationship becomes broken (different word for
broken here than cut).  I and Jellia have a
relationship, but if she refused to help me do
work, our relationship would be broken.
Relationships are good.  It's good to have
relationships. One person alone, is not good.  If
you are two people, three people, it's good. Like
here, now.  When we work together, with you,
language helper, Ngoho, Warraba .... it's good.
\fac MM (CONT):  Multiple ways are used here to say
that a relationship is broken (broken, cut,
finished, hard).  From our interviews with friends
it does not appear to be one consistent way in
which the relationship is described. Based on our
conversation with an SIL translator here and
based on the fact that tst4 retold this story and
naturally changed the wording of it to "cut", this
is the word that is best used here.  The SIL
translator explained, a relationship that is "cut"
can be put back together again.  A relationship
that is "finished' is done.  A relationship that is
"hard" is unclear as to what that means exactly.

would do what he said.>  Is this how you are

uncertain of this now.  If that isn't the best
interpretation, then how would you see that part

certain lands.  The one in line 04 <1Ch.01:34
-42> attests Esau's descendents, but this
particular promise elsewhere in scripture is said
to apply specifically to Isaac and his
descendents. Would be better to use an anchor
that shows Isaac, Jacob and the 12 sons, and

in Egypt.

\con DP-F2 ok
\p
\con DP I'm wondering if there is something about the
way this line is expressed <At the moment he
gathered them, Samuel has seen a nice looking
man coming. He is tall....>... that doesn't seem
to have it clear that this nice looking man coming
is one of the sons of the first man.  It sounds like
it could be just some random person coming,
maybe part of the extended "people" of the man,
or maybe not???
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Read through the Tst3:
<God sent him to a man to tell the man to
gather all his people, that among them they
would make one king.   The moment he went
there, he saw a man coming,  He was tall and
handsome. He said, "He surely is the one.  This
one will be king" Then God said, "Eiiyee.  This
one will not be king." Go ask the man, where are
your other children?">...
\con DP (CONTINUED...) This sounds even further
afield  Doesn't this sound like when Samuel had
gotten to the village he saw a tall, handsome
man coming and wanted to designate him to be
king. But God tells him no.  So Samuel asks that
man where his other children are, etc.>. In other
words, it seems like the simplification of the
story blurs the fact that there were two different
characters:  (a)  the man Samuel was sent to
find, Jesse, the father; and (b) Jesse's oldest
son, who is brought before Samuel and Samuel
wants to anoint him king.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) The tst4 retelling seems to
follow the original story more closely.  It keeps
the line <He had everybody there, there was a
man coming who was tall and handsome...>, and
that again seems like it could be some random
man.  And then later there's the line <And asked
the man "Where are all of your children (Are
these all your children?)?">  In that, when it
says <And asked the man...>, is it clear who
<the man> is referring to?  I see you ask a test
question on the original story at this point (line
14) and got the right response.  But the fact that
tst3 may have gotten the participants confused
may mean that there is something not quite
clear about the participants in the originally told
story.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) It may just be the
backtranslations that are difficult to follow as
they reflect more of a Supyire way of tracking
the participants.  But I think it would be worth
making sure, as that would be a significant
inaccuracy caused by the simplification.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Perhaps one way for you to
figure this out is go back to tst3 and tst4 and
play the recordings to them of their own
retelling.  (Or if that isn't appropriate, play it for
someone altogether new.)  Then get some stick
figures or cut outs of paper to represent
characters in this story.  But instead of you
naming all the characters, have this person
you've played the recording for designate a
figure or cutout for each of the characters, and
then walk you through the story moving these
stick figures around. You should be able to tell
from that whether they are distinguishing
between the man Samuel was sent to find
(Jesse), versus his oldest son (the one Samuel
first wanted to anoint as king).
\con DP (CONTINUED...) It may even be worthwhile
doing the stick figure / cut out thing with your
crafter as he tells through the story to make
sure he's got it straight. And where he says <At
the moment he gathered them, Samuel has seen
a nice looking man coming. He is tall. >... ask
him who that nice looking man coming is.

particular bit?  Might you just want to delete it

\con LB re <heart>. Do the Supy. people have a
"heart" expression as well?  I see under tst
under 17.20 that the tester used "his heart is
good". How do people in everyday language use
it? Also, do you know how do they talk about the
character of a person?
\fac MM:  The Supyire people do use the heart to
describe a person's character.  They have a
similar heart expression as we do.  They also
sometimes use a person's insides to describe
whether he is "good" or "bad".  But in this case,
it is understood that by God looking at man's
heart, He is looking at their insides. There are
also Supyire expressions involving the heart:
There is a word for "good heart" which also
means honesty. There is a word for faithfulness
that involves the heart.  If you say the heart is
bad, then the person is greedy and covetous.
These are a few examples.

\con LB re<Philistines> Is there a reason you identify
the enemy at this stage? Did they have trouble
using that name in the retelling? I notice in the
answer, that the tester identified the enemy as
"Goliath and his people", thus avoiding the
foreign word. Unless you have "Philistines" in
previous or later stories, you might consider not
including it in this story.
\fac kh: the Philistines is a foreign word which is why
we wanted it to be clear that they are the enemy
of Abraham's people. The Philistines do come
into the next David story as well, 12 David
defeats his enemies.  We wanted it to be clear
that David and the people of Abraham are
fighting the same enemy in both of these
stories.  Do you suggest totally removing the
name?
\con LB1 No, not necessarily. I just wanted to draw
your attention to look at this as well as wanting
to know if in retelling the story, they had trouble
to use that name. How did that go? If they
usually substitute "Goliath and his people" in the
retelling, that might be your indicator as to it
being difficult to remember and help you decide
whether or not to keep the "Philistine" word. The
fact that you use it in at least the next story
provides continuity in either case. Please let me
know if there are changes.
\fac kh1:  In  our most recent testing session the
Philistines were referred to by name as
"Philiti-people" and by "Goliath's people". The

\con DP Re <These lines may be simplified and the
direct dialogue removed.>... differences
between direct and indirect dialogue is
something to keep you eye on.  However, it is
often the case that the first few times someone
retells a story, it is common for them to make
direct dialogue into indirect. It seems to have to
do with the reteller not yet being to the point of
telling as vivid a story as the original storyteller
has done -- they are still too busy trying to
remember the details.  So I don't know that you
should give a lot of weight to this.  I've seen
other cases in this story set where the reteller
has made something into direct dialogue that in
the original was not.  So it may just be stylistic.
Usually direct dialogue is more vivid and
interesting, makes for a better story.  So unless
you know something about direct vs indirect
speech use in Supyire, I'd suggest you usually
go in the direction of direct speech.

point here.  Are you saying that the Supyire
phrase that was backtranslated in the original
story <In the name of Almighty God> is same
Supyire phrase that you backtranslated in the
retelling as <The Almighty God agree>? How
would you translate that very literally into
English -- as close to the Supyire phrase as you
can get?
\fac MM:  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  However,
here, it actually is a Bambara phrase that means
"In God's power".  Our craftor stated that this is
a phrase commonly used and one in which
everyone will understand. However, further in
the story set, we use the Supyire phrase, "In the
name of God" or "In the name of Jesus", so this
phrase will either be deleted or changed to the
Supyire.  See 'name" in the most recent key
term list for this Supyire phrase.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) The phrase <in the name
of> is a key biblical term that should figure into
the L&C Notes.  See also the Key Biblical Terms
document under <Name>.  A ways down into
that entry are the different expressions for <in
the name of>.
\fac MM:  This keyterm has been added.  
\con DP (CONTINUED...) There are several other
places in the story set where the phrase <in the
name of> occurs.  For example 54:14 <baptized
in the name of Jesus>.  How does the Supyire
NT translation express that phrase?  Is it same
or different as what appears in this David &
Goliath story?
\fac MM:  The Supyire NT literally translates it "In the
name of Jesus"; however here, the phrase "in
the name of " is different.  It will be changed. 
This phrase will be changed to state, "With God's
power".

\con LB  question. As with story 18, I am assuming
this story was not crafted from a previous

expression or not.

\fac MM1:  David, in doing a final read through of the
story set, and looking cohesively at the
redemptive themes of relationship and power,
we recognize that no where in the series of
"David" stories, does it explicitly mention the
relationship between God and David.  However,
it seems clear that the relationship aspects are
there as David trusts in God, speaks with God,
hears from God, acts in accordingly to His trust,
obediently folllows ..etc.  Many commentaries
explicitly draw out the relationship between
David and God. However, do you feel we should
make it explicitly stated somewhere in the David
series that, "There was a good relationship
between David and God.  Why?  Because David
trusted God.  God made David a powerful king."
The relationship theme seems clear without
making it explicit.  But this could be added if you
feel it would strengthen the intertwined power
and relationship theme.
\con DP-F I agree, it seems it is plenty clear as is
without using those particular words.

\fac kh: thanks
\con LB re<The response (particularly the part that
says "God made them") This may be an
indication that the significance of the comment
the elders make is lost.  TN has a very nice
explanation of the significance, and respondents
should at least be able to grasp that the people
were trying to make some expression of
solidarity or loyalty, and not just the general
notion that "...we are all family because God
made us all"....
\fac kh: What scripture is striving to communicate
about the significance of their loyality to David is
communicated. The fact that it was the elders
who went to David, said this, then made him king
does show that loyality here, here with the
Supyire the elders woud never do this without
their loyality.  This act shows this here, i
apologize if this was clearly articulated in my
testing results.
\con LB I would suggest testing this with a few more
people.  If no one gets a response that is more
in keeping with the significance, then you may
want to consider omitting this. Also, when you
get a response like "God made them", it would
be good if you immediately follow up to try to
figure out what was prompting this sort of
response.

Could you test more specifically "Why did the
enemy scatter?" If its not clear, TN gives several
ways to render this, like: â€œAs water breaks
through a dike, 5.205:20c the LORD has broken
out against my enemies before me.â€ so YHWH
has enabled us to break through the defenses of

\con DP2 Re <Baal's ... messengers>, it seems you
are using the same word for Baal's prophets as
for God's prophets.  Note that throughout the
retelling of the story this is always expressed as
something else.  Here it is <Baal people>, which
seems innocuous.  But in some places later it
gets expressed as <Abraham's offspring
(people)>.  That is, the distinction between these
<prophets of Baal> and the larger group of
Abraham's offspring is blurred.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) You may want to consider
with the crafter whether using the Supyire
traditional term for a fetish priest might be more
effective when referring to these prophets of
Baal.  In addition to helping keep the different
groups of people clearly distinguished in the
story, this sort of traditional <fetish priest> term
could be a more interesting contextualization -- it
may make the hearers take note in comparison
to their own tendency to go to the fetish priest.
\fac MM2:  Yes, I agree that they have blurred these
lines.  To make this clear, we have taken your
suggestion.  There is a word for a person here
who is "responsible" for the fetish sacrifices and
is seen as the "chief" of the fetish.  People can
come to this person and ask this person to
intercede or make a sacrifice to the fetish on
their behalf.  These "fetish chiefs" are literally
called "fetish worshippers" because they are the
ones who are physically doing the sacrifice and
act of "worshipping" the fetish.  This term will be
used here in place of Baal's messengers.  Also, it
was explained that people may think the word
"Baal" is referring to a person and thereby take
it to mean "one person's fetish".  To eliminate
further confusion, this has been simplified to
fetish and fetish worshippers.  The reference to
Baal has been removed from the story.  See

\con LB re<our Father> What is your reason for
choosing this term here for God? Is this the first
time you used this keyterm for God in your
stories?
\fac KH:  THis is within the back-translation.  Here in
our story our crafter uses the same term he has
used before for "Almighty". [KH: Almighty] has
been added to the BT.
\con LB2 re<our Father> Let me just see if I
understand you right. Do you have the term
"Almighty" in here as well as Father, or is what
the back translator gave as "father" really should
be translated "Almighty"?
\fac kh1: so it is a bit confusing huh?  they all mean
"Lord".  Our backtranslator did not know the
term for Lord until not long ago, he would switch
back and fourth between words trying to
describe the Lord.  It is in the L&C notes as both
"almighty" from before and now "Lord".  I
changed the [] in the BT to Lord, as it should be.
\fac MM:  Based on conversations regarding the
keyterms used for "God", "Lord", "Lord God" in
the ConNotes of story 02, the terms here will all
be changed to state "God". Throughout the story
set, whenever scripture refers to the "Lord God",
our story set will use the keyterm "God". See
L&C Notes for this keyterm.

\con DP2 Re <If our Father [KH: Lord] is the true God
worship [MM: {praise}] him, if Baal is the true
god worship [MM: {praise}] him.">... note that
the complex nature of this phrase was not
reproduced in the retelling.  Rather you got
<When are you going to praise God, or will your
praise Baal?>  The sense you are getting in the
retelling isn't bad or wrong, but it's not the same
sense as what the original is trying to convey. 
You may need to unpack the wording a bit to get
something reproducible with the same sense.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) You might try something
like <You shouldn't worship both. You need to
choose. If you believe that God is true / real /
most-important, then you should only worship
him.  If you believe that Baal is true / real /
most-important, then you should only worship
him.>
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Or you could leave this line
out.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) As it is, your retelling is
only giving you a repetition of the previous line
of the story.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) You might be wondering at
this point why I take the time to bring this up,
since the retelling didn't go in a bad direction. My
reason is that when you get an entire line like
this omitted or not expressed with the right
sense in a retelling, you need to consistently
consider whether allowing this sort of erosion
between an original story and the first
generation of retelling is not setting things up for
allowing continual erosion of stories from one
generation of tellings to the next, such that by
the time you get to a third or fourth generation
there would be no way to expect a significant
degree of retention of biblical integrity.  On the
other hand, if the stories are orally reproducible
without significant omission or distortion, and
that is how people learn to retell them (without
omitting lines or changing the sense of them),
then you are in a much better shape for ensuring
the retention of stories with biblical integrity.

a desire to "cover all their bases" when it comes
to spiritual matters.  
\con LB2 re<true God> thanks for your explanations.
Does this expression literally talk about true vs.
false or what is in that word "true God".
\fac kh1: it is very literally broken down into the
words we know for "true" and "God".
\con DP2 For responding to the comments above, it
would be best to have a testing question like
<What kinds of things does a "true God" do that
one who is not a "true God" might do?> But I
think the fact that you are getting both Tst3 and
Tst2 (e.g. in line 40) using this phrase in
responses means it is probably ok.
\con DP2 Does the Supyire NT or Gen use this same
Supyire word used here for <true> in
characterizing God anywhere?
\fac MM2:  Yes.   John 8:26 - Jesus says the one who
sent him is "true".  John 17:3 - "Now this is
eternal life, that they may know you, the only
True God .... . "  1 Cor 10:20, the Supyire draft
references the "True God" here also.  Gal 4:8 -
in reference to those that are not god, it say
they are not the "true God".

I might expect from a Christian.  Is this Tst3
(Day Guard) a Christian?  Your 00 introductory
record doesn't give much information about his
background.  Based on your interaction with him
now over several stories, does he seem to have
some sort of Christian background?  (Include
your response to this in the 00 introductory file
as well, please. Thanks.)
\fac MM2:  We do not have a lot of background
information on him.  As we discussed in our
Skype conversation, we know that in the past, he
has attended the church here in town on a few
occasions.  My understanding is that he has only
gone a handful of times. He does not profess to
be a Christian, but he knows we are. Most people
here in town have been influenced by
Christianity in some way.  Whether it is from the
local Supyire church, from seeing the Jesus film,
from discussions around a tea pot, or from radio
programs.  Based on the responses from him on
the last several stories, I would say he has about
the average amount of Christian influence and
background for this area.  He is unfamiliar with
the stories.  He did say that he has seen the
Jesus film.

\fac kh:  okay so the story's literal backtranslation of

talking with our crafter it is my understanding in
Supyire you would not/ could not say, "later in
the afternoon" The time frame we in the west
know as noon last several hours here, it is when
the sun is at its hottest so when afternoon
actually starts it is later than what we might think
(any time after noon is how this western mind
thinks of it). So in fact this is already said in the
story just with the words used.
\con LB2 o.k.
\p
\con DP2 Re <sacrifice>, this is the first place now
that this word is used in the story set. (And it is
used in a number of following lines in this
story.)  In story 06 line 19 your crafting note
said <most all sacrifices here are offered to
fetishes here to gain power over something or to
curse/ harm someone.  So in order to avoid
possible misinterpretations of what Abraham is
doing or sacrificing to, it is generically stated that
Abraham was worshiping God.>...
\con DP2 (CONTINUED) Here now in story 20 you
have a similar situation, a godly person
sacrificing to the true God.  Can you explain why
the situation different here in story 20 would be
different than in story 6?
\fac MM2:  This case is different from the previous
stories.  Here, the details of the sacrifice are not
left up to the imagination. The details of the
sacrifice are described in great length.  They
gather stones, wood, arrange the wood on the
stones, and  put the sacrifice (here, once an
animal is killed for use in a sacrifice, it is called
"sacrifice") on top.  Here, it is described in great
length how the "fetish worshippers" were
worshipping a false god, while Elijah was making
a sacrifice to His true God.  In previous stories, 
the word "sacrifice" would have been used in a
single sentence with the purpose of express that
they were praising God.  In these previous
stories, the details of the sacrifice would have
been left up to the imagination. What exactly
they were doing, why they were doing it, and
what god where they sacrificing to... these
questions would have been unanswered and
possibly led to justifying their actions in this
culture of using "intermediaries" or "fetishes" in
attempting to make sacrifice to God or in
attempts to gain His power.  In conclusion, while
the point of using the phrase "sacrifice" in 
previous stories, was a small side note in the
story to express "praise" and "thanks" to God;
This story is built around this sacrifice event, the
concept of the "sacrifice" is unpacked
thoroughly, and the point that they were making
sacrifices to a false god is made clear.
\con DP-F Sounds reasonable.  Could you include in
the L&C notes entry (which is very nice, by the
way), something like this about why in earlier
stories you went generic (praise / worship), but
here went specific?  Thanks.

\con DP2 Re <Tst3:  Why did Eli put water on the bull
3x?  He wanted it wet, so the sacrifice would

you get a testing response like this, be slow to
assume that this response to this point makes it
totally clear what is being understood.  In this
sort of case it is better to ask a follow up
question like <How does it being wet show them
the true God?> I don't think it is a big enough
issue here that you need to go back and test in
this particular case, but for future reference in
your testing, follow through with other questions
that show whether or not the logical conclusion
has indeed been reached.

a people group for himself should be built.  We
have decided to go with "Brehima's God" and for
the people of Israel we are using "Brehima's
offsprings people" also seems to be well
understood. But this section of the story has
been changed to "Brehima's God".
\con LB2 re <Brehima's God> I agree, it will be good
to build that connection as you said. For here,
since the anc says, "prove today that you are

It literally means that the hearts/ minds/ desires
of the people are going to change and follow
God.  Here, many times your insides hold your
emotions and desires.  For the "heart to join
you" is a very strong way to say that they agree
and will follow.

from the word you had translated as "true"
earlier? In testing, what do people say about the

\fac KH:  No, this is the same word, I have added it
to the BT.  So far in testing it has been
understood that the Baals are a type of fetish,
which is well understood here.  [ story time:
Sadly a few weeks ago we went to a party in our
village that our women have been talking about
and planning for for months.  The day finally
comes and we get all dressed up and go out in
the fields to a stream of water and their is
singing and dancing, chickens killed and blood all
over this very larger bolder.  Our brother/

is the Supyire's view of violence. Keep it in mind

call, just my caution.
\fac KH:  From all that we know the Supyire people
seem to be a very peaceful people group.  We
left that part in the story because, to us, it
communicates a huge need to follow the true
God and not false gods.  But we do not want to
create a barrier, i will check into this further.
\con LB2 That will be good. Some "why" and "how"
questions  could be revealing here.
\fac kh1"  sorry about the lack of quality testing
questions and results, this was all done before
we had our consultant review, then learning the
insight to be had by more targeted why & how
questions.  These will be added after its next
testing session.
\fac MM:  See updated BT file for additional testing
questions and comments.  Any further thoughts
on the ending of the story? The length of the
story could be reduced by ending the story at
line 43.
\con DP2 The further sort of testing that might show
whether this is an appropriate ending for the
context of not, might be something like <So,
what do you think about them having killed these
Baal people?  Was it good for them to kill them? 
Why or why not?>
\con DP2 Or alternatively, I'd be supportive as well if
you decided to just end the story at line 43. That
seems to be a very nice, strong way to end a
story.
\con DP2 A possible consideration suggestive of not
having this "killing" ending is that in the West
African context (a place where there is indeed
killing between Mslms and Chrstns), we wouldn't
want the stories to be interpreted to be justifying
or promoting that.

expressed in the Supyire language?  Is an
abstract concept like <peace> something that
can be <given>. (In many language it is not.) If
it is not a natural way of expressing it in Supyire,
then you might search on <peace> in the NT in
TW and find how those places are expressed in
the Supyire NT, and see if there are other more
natural ways to express it than <give peace>,
e.g. like <cause us to have peace / cause us to
be in good relationships>. I'd suggest you be
hesitant to label as performance error (i.e. being
nervous and not able to say what you would
normally remember) something that is a key
biblical term, particularly when it is bound up in a
seemingly tight, figurative expression like <give
us peace>.
\fac MM:  In our language, "peace" is something that
can be "given".  It is actually a common blessing
here, "May God give you peace." It is expressed
in the Supyire NT in Luke 8:48 - "God give you
peace.", in Luke 10:5 for the phrase "Peace be in
this house", it is expressed as "May God give
you all peace."  Again in Luke 24:36 when Jesus
says "Peace to you.' In Supyire NT - it states it
as "May God give peace to you." Based on this
frequent usage in the Supyire NT, and on its
usage in such manner in everyday life (i.e.
blessings - May God give peace to you.), I felt
this omission was performance error and not an
unnatural way of expressing something.
\con DP2 ok

\ln 22.09
\con DP The anchoring shifts at this line from Isa ch 9
to ch 53, which was likely a prophecy Isaiah
delivered at a different time and place.  Unless
there is something in the Supyire language in
this story at this point that doesn't make it into
the BT, it would seem that the story would need
to start out this line with something like <And
another time Isaiah spoke about this one who
was going to be king.   He said:  He will do no
wrong...>.  Otherwise, it isn't painting an
accurate picture of these two prophetic
utterances of Isaiah in the broader context of the
book of Isaiah.
\fac MM:  I agree that in the broader book of Isaiah,
this story  inaccurantely respresents this as one
prophecy, while in truth it is two separate
prophecies.  However, when working with a
story, here, the story within the story is Isaiah's
prophecy about the child who is to be king.  It is
anchorable that the two scripture segments here
are both referring to Christ.  Is it not acceptable,
in story format, to leave this as is (a story within
the story, all anchorable, all are Isaiah's words
that God has given him). While it would be easy
enough to put the statement you suggest within
the story, it would break the story flow.  I am
just curious if this is possible in storying.
\con DP2 Generally the stories in a OneStory project
should accurately reflect the larger biblical
context from which they come, including not
portraying something as being said in one single
setting, if it was compiled from different settings.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Aside from the specific
accuracy issue, if a prophecy story makes it
seem very transparent that a child-king was
going to be born who would be called these
things, but that he would he would be refused
and suffer, die and rise again, then there is a
more general issue of the presentation of the
whole of scripture in the panorama of having it
seem so obvious that only very stupid people
could have missed that Jesus was fulfilling these
things.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) The religious leaders were
not stupid in this way.  And even his disciples
who were with Jesus day in and day out missed
much of it.  Jesus had to explain it to them after
he came back to life. It was not at all as clear as
the sort of presentation you are proposing here
is laying it out to be. This sort of simplification
has the good likelihood of skewing things in a
way that don't align with the overall presentation
of scripture on this matter.

check how the Supyire NT expresses the similar
concept at Heb.09:28 and 1Pe.02:24.  Please let
me know how these express the concept of
Jesus "bearing sin".
\fac MM:  Heb. 09:28 states, "Jesus was offered as a
sacrifice one time only." In 1Pe.02:24, it states,
"Jesus has taken the load of our sins..."  In this
last case, the word for "load" is the same as the

\con DP Re <Savior>, this key term doesn't appear in
the the proposed anchors <isa.53:05 , 06>.
\fac MM:  Yes, while there is no term "Savior " in
these verses.  It is stated that the Lord put on
this one the guilt and sins of us all.  Does that
not imply that this one "saves" us from the guilt
and sin deserved?  In this case, based on
implied meaning here, can not the word "savior"
be used to refer to this one? Or would it be best
to use the word "this king", and tie back to line
07 (however, the word "king" is not used within
the anchor either); or you could leave this
pronoun as "him"; but that might open up
questions as to who this is referring to.
\con DP2 Following along the lines of the discussion at
line 09 above, there is also the issue that for the
term <servant> in Isa 42, 50, 52, 53 there are
two traditions of interpretation (i.e. one tradition
taking <servant> as primarily referring to the
nation of Israel, vs and the other as referring to
the Messiah).  See the Young and the Oswalt
commentaries in TW beginning at Isa 42:1.  Both
commentaries point out that the NT makes it
clear that the servant is later identified as being
the Messiah.  But the differing interpretations
wouldn't be possible unless there were some
ambiguity.  The use of the term <servant> in
some places in Isaiah clearly refering to
<Israel> and seeming in other places to refer to
<Messiah>, is what leads to the interpretion
differences.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...)  It would be safer to use
something more anchorable to what the passage
has here in Isa.52:13 introducing the section,
<God's servant>, rather than being entirely
explicit about him at this point in messianic
terms.  Perhaps consider using <(God's / his)
worker> as you did in story 58:12.  E.g. <But
God put the load of our sins on his worker> (and
use the Isa.52:13 anchor for this term).  Best to
let it have the same level of ambiguity or
openness to interpretation as the passage itself
is.
\fac MM1:  Understood.  Okay, we will modify to "His
worker".  But the last line of the story, will

\fac MM:  This originally came from TN, Gen 15:06 in
terms of "righteousness" that God credited to
Abraham.  In this case, it may be best for me to
reference that story line anchor instead of

\con LB1 re<testing by re-telling story> Could you
please say about testing results that show
learnability of story with the current degree of
detail right up front in your  \co notes. You did
include test results further down. It would help to
see how it went in your intro notes.
\fac MM2:  See updated BT file with updated testing
comments.
\con DP2 ok
\p
\con LB1 This story should have more "how" and
"why" questions. That might have really helped
discover, why some of the connections were not
made with the S. speakers. Like your note
indicates MM:  In testing, it was  unclear as to
why the people were amazed and what exactly
the angel told the shepherds.
\fac MM1:  Additional testing questions from our
second testing group have been added to the

answers. These are mostly "Why" and "How"
questions.
\fac MM2:  Again - see additional testing comments.

would you think of using <Jhn.01.19 -25 and
Luk.03:15> for this part?  If so, please split the
first line off as 02a, and anchor it separately

\con DP2 Re <One day...> this is used a number of
times in the Gospels stories (and appropriately, I
would expect), since those events happened
over a period of weeks, months, in some cases a
few years.  But between the Isaiah story and this
Birth of Jesus stories, more than 400 years
passed. If the inference from the <One Day>
here is such that it might seem like a few weeks,
months or years (rather than centuries), then
you may want to consider saying something like
<Hundreds of years / many generations later...>

her to be the mother of his Son. Another way to

\con LB1  Your note is helpful here about the "throne",
as it shows you understood it to be a figure of
speech here. Again, it would be good to show
both your question and the answer from the S.
speaker.
\con DP2 Re {throne}, I've asked for more
information about this keyterm in the L&C notes
elsewhere (see story line 12.20c).  In addition to
what I mentioned there, could you say
something in the L&C notes as well about what
the traditional "throne" concept in Supyire
involves? Is it referring to a literal chair of some
sort that only chiefs or kings use? Thanks.
\fac MM3:  L&C Notes had been updated to include
this information.  You must not have the most
recent file.  I will send it.  I have not had a
chance to do more research on the "literal chair"
aspect, but the figurative usage is included now
in the notes.
\con LB1 re<The Father God is going to give him the
throne.  He is going to stay on the throne
forever."> Could you still ask to tst "why is
Father God going to give him the throne?" and
"Why is he going to stay on the throne forever?"
\fac MM1:  We will test further.
\fac MM2:  See further testing comments.
\con DP-F The testing responses here don't really
show how <throne> is understood as a figure for
ruling.  But there seem to be places elsewhere in
the panorama that do, and the fact that it is used
through the S translation...
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con DP-F Re <God is going to give him the
{throne}> in the story, where the anchor
passage has <...give him the throne of his father
David.>  For cohesion, since your OT stories
have the promise related to the throne of David,
it would seem that this simplification might be
unfortunate.  More than that, though in the Sight
story you have the blind man shouting <Jesus of
David's offspring people...>, but this story has
failed to build the background that Jesus was a
descendent of David.  This could be a simple
(but powerful) thing to have in the story.
\fac MM-F:  Line added and retold in final testing
again with Tst4.
\con DP-F2 ok.  Please add Luk.01:33 as part of the

\fac MM-F2:  OK.

\con LB re<God's soul> Is this the word used in the
Supyire NT ?
\fac MM:  Yes, this is the same word here used in the
Supyire NT draft .
\con LB1 o.k.
\con DP2 Your comments about unpacking the term
for <God's Spirit> here at the first place it
occurs are appropriate.  If you can flesh it out in
a way that both keeps the term you will be using
elsewhere, but emphasizes and unpacks it, then
you could possible set hearers / retellers up to
use it in retellings in this and other stories as
well.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Part of what might help is
to not just use <God's Soul> as part of a longer
sentence with other things in it the first time it
occurs (as it currently is in <God's soul [MM:
{spirit}] will come into you. >) But instead, use
some sort of more presentational wording, e.g.
<It's God's Soul [said with exagerratedly
emphasis on <God's Soul>, who will do/cause
this.  That is his power that will come into you /
shadow over you ....]  (or however the Supyire
NT expresses the "shadow" concept here.)
\fac MM3;  Yes.  We will unpack this term in this way.
\con DP-F You note that <God's Spirit> as a key term
didn't get reproduced in retelling and say <It
may be best to also state "God's power will come
to you" to unpack this more.>  and then
<Tst4.... It may be best to also state "God's
power will come to you" to unpack this more.>.
I'm not sure whether you are still planning to
revise toward this some more, or whether the
current form already has a revision sort-of like
this. Have you tested this new wording for oral
reproducibility?
\fac MM-F:  Current line is the revised version.  It
was retold as is in a retest.
\con DP-F2 ok
\p
\con LB1  <the child ... will be a great person>...
Actually, it's not clear what that corresponds to
in the anchor --  holy?  If so, it doesn't seem
quite right.  Is this what the S translation has in
Luk 1:35
\fac MM1:  Yes, this is anchored by luk.01:32.  See
revised BT anchor.
\con LB2 o.k. 
\p
\con LB re<"great> good natural expression of
"she-bow" .could you clarify for me if this refers
to Mary or the child?
\fac MM:  It is evident in backtranslation and testing
that it is the child who will become the
"she-bow", not Mary.
\con LB1 thanks -- that clarifies. You have shown their
answer. It would have been helpful to know how
you asked for the tst question here.
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con DP2 Re <Tst4: In retelling this particular line,
she states, "God said to her...>, instead of the
original story line <Then the angel said...>, this
variance between <the angel saying>  and <God
saying> is significant.  Could you say how you
plan to address this?
\fac MM3:  I was not planning to change the story
text based on this.  Here in Supyire culture, if
someone is commissioned or sent by someone
else, then it is understood that the words given
are from the source of that messenger.  It would
be culturally acceptable for her, in retelling this
story, to make a slight error and simply say
"God" told her as she knows this angel is sent
from God and speaking on his behalf.  She
started off the dialogue by stating the angel
came to her and said ... she simply switch over
in line 08 and said God told her... In other
retellings for the story, Day Guard friend, he
continues to say the angel told her.  I believe
this to be performance error only and not
something that needs addressing within the
story.
\con DP3 ok (particularly since the other retelling said
it with "angel")

\fac MM:  Yes, this term means king, or ruler of
kingdom.  It is a different word than chief. The
term for king is in our keyterm list.
\con LB1 o.k. Could please you add more of this info
to the entry for king in the L&C file. It only has
"sarhana", the S.S. term.

\con LB2 o.k. 
\p
\con LB1 re <asked> in the phrase <there was a king
upon the kingdom who asked everyone to go
...>..Is  this  the word in Sup  that the S
translation uses here. (It sounds weak in English
for what a king would do, but may be ok in S.
Seems we see it elsewhere in this sort of
context.)
\fac MM1:  It is the same words used in the S. draft. 
It actually means more of a "commission" and is
stronger than just to ask.

\con LB re<where the horses sleep> If you can be
more generic, like "where domestic animals are
kept" that would be preferable.
\fac MM:  I think we will just delete this part of the
line. It's not anchorable, adds another detail to
an already long story and there would be much
cultural confusion over "place where domestic
animals are kept" ... here, domestic animals are
not kept anywhere, they are free to roam....
except for maybe the horse.
\con LB1 o.k. You have good reasons for deleting it.
Just see how if it still connects well to line 13.
However, if this is what the S translation has, it
can be assumed they have good reason for it
(e.g. horses might be a close-to-generic for
domestic animals.)  it would be o.k. to use it as
you had.

\fac MM1:  I could ask this in testing - however, the
cultural view:  Why would you not take care of
the sheep in the bush?  This is normal here and
very much coincides with the worldview of the
shepherds in Jesus' day.
\con LB2 O.K.

\con LB1 It is good to see your use of TN! Well done!
\con LB1 re<Lord...Christ>Please add to  key terms
for your L&C file. Perhaps you have updated it,
but I don't see it yet.
\fac MM1:  "Christ" will be removed and we will stick
with "Lord" and "God's Chosen One" - that is how
it is done in the S. draft.  We are not using the
borrowed French word for "Christ". "Lord" is in
our key terms list.
\con LB2 o.k.
\p
\con LB1 re<born to you> This part sounds rather
literal. A tst question would be:" How do you
think a saviour was born to them?" If this is not
clear, you could change it to what you have
further down still in line 15 "born to save you".
\fac MM1:  This is how it is stated in the S. draft.
\con LB2 o.k. 
\fac MM2:  See comments in BT file.
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con LB1 The line length here is pretty long, and
corresponds to four vss for the anchor. Both for
evaluating biblical accuracy and for considering
the rate of testing questions, it would be good for
you to have less content than this in a single
line.  You could divide this one into four, five or
six lines (15a, 15b etc.)
\fac MM1:  It has been divided.  
\con LB2 Good. o.k. 
\p
\con LB1 Re <savior> and <He has come to save
people>... there should be testing questions that
explore how this is understood, something like
<Why do you think he needed to save the
people?>... <What do you suppose he was
saving them from?> (The second is a content
questions, but is not answered in the particular
story.)

\con Lb re<singing> anc or other support needed. If
praising often includes singing, or praising is
equal to singing, you could add that in your
cultural notes.
\fac MM:  Yes, often singing is used as a way to
praise or even pray to God or fetishes for
animistic followers.  A cultural note has been
added here to the story.  TN also suggests,
"praising God: The angels were already giving
praise to God for Jesus’ birth when they
appeared. This could be a song or a shout."
\con LB1 Good support note.. Please add TN to your

\con LB1 re<they found the baby>"found" the baby.
This sounds very literal like English. Could you
include a tst question here like "how did they find
the baby?"
\fac MM1:  This is the word, "found" used in the S.
draft.
\con LB1  re <they found the baby lying in the animal
watering trough> When re-reading it this time, I
wondered if in lines 17 and 18 it might sound like
the baby was abandoned, since there was this
baby lying in a trough and  no mention of Mary
and Joseph in the rest of the story. Could you
ask a tst question about this. If not clear, you
might consider including a line of Luk2:16 NET So
they hurried off and located Mary and Joseph,
and found the baby lying in a manger.
\fac MM1:  This line has been reworked.  See BT.
\con LB2 o.k. 
\p
\con LB1 similar to some comments above, this is too

also include Luke 2:12, "You will find this baby in
an animal watering trough."
\con LB1 In looking at it, I wonder if you should also
mention Mary and Joseph. Else might someone
think of the baby abandoned in that trough.

\fac MM1:  It is clearer now with the reworded line. 
See test question and answer.
\con LB2 re<tst answer Because the baby was in the
watering trough.">  Could you test this some
more with "why do you think they put the baby
in the watering trough?" The reason I'd ask is to
find out if the focus is on the unusual place for a
baby to be put in rather than the birth of the
savior. The answer may aid you in deciding to
keep it the way you have it or if you need to
change something here. Please let me know the
outcome- I saw your note in line 13 BT that this
is also the word used in the Sup. NT. Its not that
the trough itself is the problem. Its the attention
it seems to get as reason for their astonishment.

\p
\con LB1 re <came from another country> would it
make it clearer to add at least "to see the baby".
- As I had said in line 22, which now is different,
it might possibly make the whole thing  clearer
to introduce them a little more slowly. I don't
know about how they would do that in Sup. Here
is a suggestion, something like, "there were
other people that came to see/visit that baby
also. These  people came from another country
and were very important. Why did they come?
Because they knew a king was born and they
wanted to show him respect. ." Then it links
nicely with 22.
\fac MM1:  Yes, we will modify this line to expand it
slightly.  See revised BT.
\con LB2 re<to see the baby> good. o.k.
\p
\con DP-F Re <Because they knew that a king was
born...> with the selection / simplification in this
story from the full passage, might hearers be
infering that news about this newborn king had
spread far and wide and everybody new it? That
would clearly not be the case, e.g. with
Mat.02:03 ff where Herod (the existing king)
heard this for the first time from these important
people from another country.
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...)  <Tst3:  How did they
know the baby was the king?  Because they
heard the words of the others praising him and
God and they knew he was the king and
savior.>... This would seem to indicate the
unfortunate inference is there.
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) With the unfortunate
inference above, and with the time being short to
your departure, and with this being as long a
story as it is, and nowl having some other newly
revised lines in it and lines that the bt-of-retelling
missed, I suggest you omit these final two lines

\con LB re<stars> should be "star"
\fac MM:  This line has been deleted due to the
confusion in testing and cultural baggage
associated with "following a star"
\con LB1 it probably is a good decision, to eliminate
this part, especially for the reasons given.
\con DP-F ok
\p
\ln 26.22
\con LB I like your reasons for including the Wise Men
story. I wonder if the difficulty with confusion
may have to do with the way the Wise Men were
introduced in line 20, as I had mentioned there.
An example of introducing them more
specifically might be something like:" There were
some other men, wise men who came to see the
baby. Why? Because they knew that an
important baby had been born, but they didn't
know where he was. So they went to the king of
that country/kingdom and asked if he might
know where that boychild was, so that they could
go and honour that important child. They said to
that King, We are looking for the baby that was
born, to respect him, but we do not know, where
he is." This is a suggestion of unpacking a lot of
information in your line 20.
\fac MM:  This portion has been simplified to reduce
confusion, to shorten an already long story, and
to eliminate cultural baggage associated with
"wise men" and "following a star".  The reasons
this portion of the story remains in the story, has
not changed and is still seen in the simplified
version.
\con LB1 o.k.

\con LB re<gave him gifts with joy.> Thats good. You
may want to add something as to the value of

\fac MM:  Sometimes an "expensive" gift is not
always viewed as a good thing.  It may be seen
putting the gift-receiver in debted to the
gift-giver by a large amount. Therefore, we will
just leave it as a gift that they give with joy to
make sure it is seen as a positive thing.

\p
\con DP Re <John> in the phrase <At that same
{moment}, John was baptizing people in a
desert place.>... since this is the first time John
comes into the stories, the way the bt is worded
here makes me wonder if he is being introduced
in a natural way as a new / unknown character.
Compare the way Noah, Abraham and Elijah
were introduced in your prior stories -- all in
seemingly more natural ways (at least it seems
so from the bt.)
\fac MM2:  Yes, good point.  There is now a better
introduction for John.  See revised BT.

\con DP Re <KH:  Within the French Bible Parole De
Vie "change your way of living" is used for
repent.>... how does the Supyire translation
express this concept?
\fac MM2:  The Supyire expreses exactly as stated
here in the story.  It literally is translated
"change your way of goings". Based on this, this
line will remain as is for now.  It is also used in
future stories.
\fac MM3:  Based on previous difficulties in retelling
this phrase, and on the repeated occurance of
the concept of "Jesus' road" and "taking God's
road" in testing questioning, the concept of
"repentence" will be changed and expressed as
"leaving your old road and taking Jesus' road (or
God's road)."  This expression of "leaving your
road" contains the same idea as changing your
ways, leaving behind you the things that you
were doing, the road that you were walking and
turning to a new way, the Jesus road.
\con DP-F Proposed revision <This line will be
changed to, â€œThis will show that you have left
your old road and taken Godâ€™s road.â€> seems

\con LB1 Could you please write back the actual
backtranslation for the addition as I don't see it
yet in the BT. Thanks.
\fac kh1: Well the way it is said in Supyire, we have
"Then the persons from God's prayer house
came to John to be baptized."
\fac MM:  See BT and testing comments for this line
and next.  As there could be possible confusion
and blurring between the general people and the
"persons from God's praying house", and why
John is calling them vipers; the line should be
changed as suggested or simply deleted from
the story.
\con DP Good observation!
\fac MM2:  We have changed this line and the line
has been retold in retelling.  It seems clear in
retesting and questioning as to why John is
calling them snakes.  However, there still is a
possible blur between God's Praying House
people and the general crowd in line 08a.  In
retelling, he stated, "Then they asked him...",
making it sound like it's only the people of God's
Praying House asking John this.  We will expand
to say, "Then, the crowd of people who were
there, asked him ..."
\con DP-F Re <MM**  This will be changed to "leaders

to cohesively match the "road" theme.  "If you
only came to be baptized so people will think you
are on God's road, but you have not left your old

\fac MM:  See question proposed in testing comments
here.  Any suggestions?
\con DP Responding here to your question about
<God's Savior that they were waiting for to
come> as an expression for <Christ> here and
elsewhere.  What you are proposing does seem
to be quite nicely aligned with one of the
proposed renderings in the Key Biblical Terms
document in TW.  I understand this to be
different from what the Supyire translation uses
for Christ, which is <God's Chosen One>.  But
as you note, with the seeming difficulty in
retellings of reproducing this term, and with the
<...Savior...> expression being more thematic
for the panorama, you are on solid ground with
the <...Savior...> expression. (The expression,
though different from the one used in the
Supyire translation, does not seem to run
counter to it, so should be fine on that
consideration.)
\con DP (CONTINUED...) For clarity (and to distinguish
it from mere "Savior" when it isn't referring to
"Christ" in a particular anchor verse) I wonder if
you might be willing to use {Christ} as the jump
from the bt file and the key word in the L&C
notes entry.  So, something like <They were
thinking he is God's Savior they were waiting for
to come [KT: {Christ}].>
\fac MM:  Yes, we are still researching what is best to
use for "Savior" to differentiate it as "Christ" -
whether that is "God's Savior", "Future Savior",
"Promised Savior"...?  We will discuss this with
our craftor, then update.
\fac MM3  This has been updated to "Savior we are
waiting for"  {KT: Christ}.  This phrase was
naturally told several times by our craftor, has
been retold, and maintains a cohesive nature
with the use of "Savior" throughout the story set.

\ln 28.10
\con DP Re <In tst2 he said, "Then John said, there is
one coming after me, I baptize with only water." 
The omission of "He is more powerful than me"
could be performance error.  It will remain in the
story.> I can understand your desire to retain
this in the story.  Let's see if after the revisions
you are planning you can get a good retelling
that retains it.  Hopefully so.
\fac MM3:  This was retold in the latest retesting.  It
will remain.
\con DP-F ok
\p
\ln 28.11
\con LB re<I am not even allowed to...> with the
answer given of "more powerful than John" you
might ask another question to test, if this might
be looked at as a power struggle.
\fac MM:  See additional note in testing comments to
unpack this further.
\con DP Your suggestions for revision sound good...
e.g. <My head is low, next to his.> and <who
will save you...>.  This last one should be
anchored by Luk.03:17, per the note in TN
<gather the wheat into his barn: ... This
represents Jesus saving people....>.
\fac MM2:  Okay.  Revised.  
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con LB re <untie his shoes> why would someone
want to do that?
\fac KH: This was all discussed in our last testing of
this story, Jesus is too high. It’s like we are too
inferior to untie the shoes of ATT (Malian
President).  There is a big gap in societal status
between the two. This is a parable, not reality.
People don’t actually untie others shoes here. But
the parable is well known.
\con LB1 seems to get across despite the lack of
cultural relevance. Thats o.k.  I am not sure I
understand what you mean with "its a parable".
What is a parable?
\fac kh1:  a parable here means it is a story or
example that is good and used to teach or show
the value of something but is a story/ word
picture to help reach/show a point. (by the way,
our friends here are the ones who described this
as a parable)
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con DP-F Re <Tst2 (retest):  in retelling, he states
the line, as well as the new phrase "My head is
low next to his."  However, he includes the
phrase "I baptize you in water only, but He is the
one who is going to baptize people with ...." This
actually sounds more natural than as is.  It will
be moved.>... I think you are saying some of
this still remains to be done.  If so, it should be
ok, but again... the weight of the things to be
changed is beginning to be a bit much for this
stage.
\fac MM-F:  Revised.  
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) Re <allowed> in the
phrase <I am not even allowed to untie his
shoes>, seems a bit far from the intended
meaning, which is <Compared to him, I'm not
even as good as the lowest slave/servant who
would be untying his shoes.>.  (Or see TN for
other possibilities.)
\fac MM-F  Phrase has been deleted.  The concept of
"my head is low next to his" conveys that
compared to Jesus, John is low.
\con DP-F2 ok

\ln 28.12
\con LB re<He is the one who is going to blow the
grain out of the useless parts (chaff). He is going
to burn the useless parts." How is this connecting
to 11? Ask question. Look TN or TH
\fac KH:  ... it was explained clearly that those who
follow God are the good parts and those who do
not are the parts who are bad and going to be
burned.
\con LB1 o.k. 
\fac MM:  Again, see proposed unpacking of this line
based on TN.
\con DP-F If you are talking about what is in the
current BT line <He is the one who is going to
blow the grain out of the useless parts [KH:
chaff].  He is going to burn the useless parts
[KH: chaff]."  In the same way, he will separate
the good people from the evil people.  He will
punish the evil people.>.... then it is fine.  I'm a
bit confused by some of the stuff in the tst lines
as to whether that is something you are still
planning to do, or that it has already been done.

\con LB1 o.k.

\con DP It would seem that one important reason you
might want to indicate in the first comment line
for having this story in the panorama is to begin
to give wording for how redemption / conversion
is expressed in terms of the "relationship"
redemptive theme.  Here in this story (lines 19
and 20) the term "trust" is used to give
expression to what people do in response to
Jesus that redeems / converts them.  According
to your L&CNote for "trust" this is the same word
used to refer to what Abraham did. That makes
for very nice cohesion and implementation of the
relationship theme. Nice work!  (Just suggesting
that you add something to your "reason for the
story" line.)

\con LB re< then a woman left> It looks like a cause
connection to her fetching water and Jesus being
there. Do you have something more generic like
"it so happened that a woman had come there
also to draw water"
\fac MM:  The Supyire word "then" used here is one
that is placed between sentences and used like
"and" in English.  It does not imply a
cause-effect connection.  This is the same word
used in all of the following lines as well as
connectors .... "and Jesus asked her ...." ..."And
the woman said..."  .. "So Jesus said.." ... "Then
the woman said ...", "Then Jesus answered.."...
It's all the same word in Supyire.   In testing

It would be good to put down an Initial to
distinguish between your answer and theirs. So if

use this device, however, at this particular

with each other is noted parenthetically, as in the
NET.

more with a question like <Do you suppose

\fac MM3:  This is an error on my BT of the retelling. 
I thought the sentence structure the reteller had
stated originally had a double negative within the
sentence, but here, in this usage the words are
not negative.  The retelling actually should state,
"Jesus spoke parables to people, all the time, he
spoke parables."  I apologize for the mistake.  It
was my fault and my "NIV" upbringings that led
me to initially backtranslate it in this manner.

revision proposed on line 15.  However, in final
read through, I wonder if Jesus' power over all
things evil would be made clearer if a sentence
remained, "The bad weeds are those who are on
the enemy Satan's road."  It clearly states in line
16c that Jesus will throw all those not on his road
into the fire; however, if we add this sentence,
we are connecting those who are not on Jesus'
road to being on Satan's road.

\fac MM:  See testing questions in StoryBT.  
\con LB1 from testing, it looks like the idiom has
enough coverage to  express the thought
appropriately. TN has this: where there will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth: The evil people
will cry for themselves in that terrible place and
grind their teeth because of their great pain. This
may also imply anger (Newman). This implies
that they will not die but will continue to suffer.
\fac MM1:  We will expand upon this just to make
sure it is clear why they are grinding their teeth
and to emphasize the pain they will be in. See
revised BT.

\fac MM2:  While in testing, it seems they understand
the figurative speech "shine like the sun";
however, would it be best to unpack it as

\con DP Either way is fine.  If people do seem to
consistently "get" a figure like this, then
sometimes it is best to leave it "packed" rather
than unpacking it.  It can give more intrigue or
interest to the story.  However, if you think there
are people who wouldn't get the underlying
meaning unless it were unpacked, then that's
fine too.  Your call -- perhaps talk with the
crafter about his opinions on something like this.

Text has "he had mercy on you". Test "strange

\fac KH:  our back-translator uses "strange thing" for
miracle.  In the NLT it says to go and tell of the
"wonderful things the Lord has done for you." 
The NASB says the"great things the Lord has
done for you" Knowing that what the Jesus did
heal him of this is seen as a great and wonderful
thing, a miracle because it is something that, as
our back-translator describes, is something that
a normal man could never do.  This "strange"
thing is seen as a very good thing, but the actual
meaning of the Supyire word can be good or
bad, understood from the context.  In testing it
was very clear that this is a good thing that
Jesus did for this man.

\con DP Re <God's praying {house}>, your L&C Note
for this has it as the word in the Supyire NT for
<temple>.  Is this the word that the NT
translation has in this anchor verse for
<synagogue> as well?
\fac MM3:  See updated L&C Notes.
\con DP-F Re the L&C Note entry for <house / God's
praying house>, where it says <Throughout our
story set we have chose to go generic in using
the term “God’s praying house” for the terms
temple & synagogue.>, using the term for
temple <God’s Prayer House.”>....
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) It is fine to go generic like
with <religious leader> to refer to specific
classes like <Pharisee, Scribe, Saducees>, and
where <religious leader> is not the specific
name for any one of these.  It wouldn't be good
to use <Pharisee>, for all of them, i.e. to use
<Pharisee>  for <Scribe> and <Saducee>. The
generic term works in such a case, because it
lumps them all together without being the name
for any one of them.
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) Similarly, it would be fine
to use a generic expression like <worship
center> to lump together <temple, synagogue,
church>.
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) But it wouldn't be
appropriate to try to use a specific word like
<synagogue> to refer generically to <church,
temple and synagogue>.  Or it wouldn't be
proper to use a specific word like <church>, to
refer generically to <temple, synagogue, church,
mosque>.  So similarly, to use <temple> to
refer to both <synagogue and temple>, is not
quite right for a biblical story.
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) This is, in essence, what
you are trying to do using a specific term for
<temple = God's Prayer House>, to generically
cover both <synagogue = God's Words
Schoolhouse> and <temple = God's Prayer
House>.  It will have the prospect of confusing
things for people who learn the stories, and then
through Supyire scripture learn that there is a
distinction to be drawn between synagogue and
temple, but have the stories calling one by the
name of the other.
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) Can you try use "God's
Words Schoolhouse>  for synagogue here?

\con LB re<God's praying big house leaders> Is this
the term used in the S.NT for religious leaders?
\fac MM: This is the term used for "leaders" and this
is the term used for "temple" or synagogue as in
john 10:23.  The S. NT uses the phrase "Jewish
leaders" or "Pharisee people" or "Saducee
people" ; however, we have simplified this.  We
do not have "Jews", "Pharisees", or "Saducees"
in the story set.  We have taken a family term -
God's praying house, and added another familiar
term to  it - the "leaders" of "God's praying
house".  In S. NT, the term "God's praying
house" is used in Jhn 10:23. In John 10:24, it
states "the Jewish leaders" where we have
stated here, line 02, the "leaders of God's

remainder of this particular story <jhn.10>.  Do
you have  a chronology guide you could use? (If
not, I could send you)  "One-Year reading plan"
you may have received in your CLS materials.)
\fac MM:  One reason for having this story in the
story set, is to set the stage for those who are
against Jesus, the clash between the religious
leaders of the day and Jesus. These introductory
lines were included in the story for part of this
purpose.  And they were retold in testing. 
However, there may be a better way to state
this.  Or line 03 could be omitted and this
thought left generic as in line 02.  I do see that
the above verses are not chronologically tied to
this story.  My apologies.
\con DP Ok.  I would be fine to either omit or retain
line 03 -- your call.  If you retain it, I'd suggest
that you just use jhn.05:16 as the only anchor

die...>.  I don't see that it is crucial at this point
for you to go back and probe that more, since

"Don't trust my words". How does the Supyire NT
have that part "even if you don't believe my

make it clear that the comparison of people to
sheep is grasped.  With regard to this question,
whenever you get a response like this that is

\fac MM:  The Supyire NT here has "Three days after
his death, he will rise."  We have made it more
explicit that he will rise from death."  It is the
same word for "rise" used here as in the Supyire
NT.  It literally means - "to wake up" or "rise". 
Does this need a key term entry if it has the

been added to key term list.
\con DP Regarding your question <Does this need a
key term entry if it has the same meaning as the
English phrase?>... Yes it is helpful for there to
be an entry for key biblical terms like this that
have been known to have potential for
misunderstanding.  This is because in many
languages the range of its senses does not
exactly correspond to the range in English or
Greek.  Giving more information on the range of
its senses in Supyire (e.g. waking up, getting up
in the morning), as well as indicating whether it
is the same as what the Supyire NT / Gen
translation has, is helpful for the consultants to
know that you have considered possible
mismatches.

those particular stories and see how you might
be able to strengthen the connections of the
prophetic stories to the fulfillment here.
\fac MM:  Much revision in the prophecy story has

is the same as the draft as in retold in both
retellings.
\con LB re< your comment Unfortunately, it sounds a
lot like "give me my eyes" in Supyire.> It may
not actually mean "have pity on me" but rather
that they chose to make this implicit request
explicit.
\fac MM:  In looking at this phrase again both in the
Supyire NT, and in the story, and upon reviewing
Supyire words; this is in fact the word for 'Pity",
"compassion", "to have pity on someone".
\con DP So you are saying the backtranslator simply
didn't backtranslate this literally enough, using a
figure of speech in Supyire instead.

\con LB re<the blind man rose up and shouted..> This
would look like an extra phrase, but it could be
just a natural way of linking it with shouting. One
way you could test this is to act out a sequence

without standing up, and asking a couple of
testing respondents (separately), if it sounds
right to describe this as "He rose up and was
shouting ...".

what happened in the story and let them tell,
what they see and hear?
\fac MM:  Yes, here it does have multiple meanings. 
The word used here can mean sad, it can also
mean "dislike", "displease", "hate".  I will ask
another testing question here to discern.  The
Supyire NT uses a different word "fahana" that
means "scolding".

man's eyes?"
\fac MM:  Here, upon review, we have made explicit
what is implicit - that he was healed and can
see.  The Supyire draft does not include that
portion of "He opened his eyes."  Maybe we
should simply add the phrase, "His eyes opened
... and he could see."  This would eliminate any

list. Are you saying that the Supyire word is the

\fac kh:  Yes this is the exact same word used in the
story, interestingly just recently our
back-translator learned the English word for
"Lord" which he has been using "Almighty" and
sometimes "Father".  The words in Supyire for
both "Lord" and "chief" are very simular but still
different, the word used for "Lord" is the same
word used in the NT draft as well.  Here the
same word is used in both places of our story.
\con LB1 o.k.
\fac MM:  See updated notes this line.  Here, in
context, the word "Lord" means "Master" and
does not need to be removed or changed from
story set.
\con DP Regarding the entry for {Master} in
L&CNotes, could you say a bit more about what
situations or contexts in Supyire culture would
involve people calling someone <Master>?  You
say in the BT file, Tst2 comment that it is
<...similar to chief>.  Do people actually call the
chief <master>? In what others sorts of contexts
might they refer to someone as <master>?
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Regarding the line from the
entry in the L&CNotes  <This is the same word
for Lord that is used in the Supyire NT.> and
<However, within this story set, this word is used
only in meaning "Master".>... I'd suggest for this
last one you say something like <However,
within this story set, this word is used only in
story 42, Triumphal Entry, where Jesus refers to
himself with this term, and the disciples repeat
it.  See keyterm for "Christ" and "God".>
\fac MM2: Upon further review and discussion, the
Supyire words for "chief" and "Lord" are two
slightly different words.  The word here originally
used for "Lord", is only used in reference to the
Lord, "Jesus Christ", or "the Lord God".  Based
on the fact that this word is not easily recognized
outside Christian circles, and on the fact that this
is the only story in the story set where it is being
used, we have replaced this word for "Lord", with
a different Supyire word, one more generic
meaning "Master" or "Teacher."  See updated
keyterm list for "Master".

\con LB re<that God give peace to that king> is this
how Supyire draft has it? (note to LB to do more
research here)
\fac kh:  "They were saying loudly, "The king who
comes in the name of the Lord God, may God
bless him, God who is above ,He is the owner of
peace; God’s name be spread out all over" This
is my backtranslation of the Supyire NT draft for
Luke 19:37.  From my understanding of this
scripture God is blessing him (the king) and He is
the owner of peace.  
\con LB1   It was good to see the quote from the
Supyire NT.  Let me break it down, as
understand this: Verse36 from the NETBIBLE:
"blessed is the king  who comes in the name of
the Lord" is translated in Supy. "The king who is
in the name of the Lord God, that God bless him"
So far so good. The phrase, again NETBIBLE:
"Peace in heaven"  is translated in Supy. as "God
who is above, He is the owner of peace. " The
phrase the people used is: "Peace in heaven"
which is really an interesting one. (The angels
used" Peace on earth" in other accounts.) I
copied TN on this for you to look at: There is
now peace between God and people, -or- May
there be peace between God and people- So,
here is a suggestion you might consider,
something like. 42.12 So the people were
praising God for the King He sent and they said:
Now there is peace between God and people.
\fac kh1:  the change has been made, see BT
\fac MM:  See proposed line change.
\con DP For the phrase <Now there is {peace}
between God and people.>, with your
redemptive theme of "relationship", might you
want to consider expressing this more in
relationship-oriented terms?
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Note, for example, that TN
says of this expression <...the phrase “peace in
heaven” seems to refer more to a peaceful
RELATIONSHIP between God, who lives in
heaven, and people...>.  The way I read your
key term entry for {peace} it doesn't exactly
seem that it would be capitalizing on the
relationship sense in this context.  It seems to
more convey something like "generally living
without problems or turmoil".
\con DP (CONTINUED...) So, for example, might you
consider expressing this more in keeping with
story 22:18 (where a revised relationship
expression in the current story 42 might be more
likely to be seen as a fulfillment of the
prophecy); ... and with story 02:21b (where a
revised relationship expression in the current
story 42 might be more likely to be seen as a
resolving of the broken relationship).

includes all of the introductory comments from
the "Betrayal" story - because this is where that

eating, Jesus picked up the bread. Having
thanked God, he broke it up and gave it to the
learners to eat. He said: “Eat this bread here.
This is my body.” OTM Matthew 26.27 26.27OTM
Matthew 26.27 Then he held the glass containing
the juice of the grape. Having thanked God, he
gave it to the learners for each to drink a bit. He
said to them: “All you drink this. OTM Matthew
26.28 What is in this glass here is my blood.
Because this is the sign now that when I die, the
new agreement God makes with you comes into
force. I will shed my blood to clear the sins of
many people. -Might that help?  Another
possibility is to have as an anc including 1. Cor
11.26. Apart from getting the connection brought
out explicitly, one wonders, how much the

meaning.

house>  is not the same term used as any of the

clear from the testing response here whether
this is well understood.  How did the retelling(s)
express this part of the story?
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Part of the issue may be that
the way the testing was phrased with <give>, in
<how he can give them Jesus>, whereas the line
of the story has <how to take Jesus to them>.  I

\con LB re <Eat this bread. It is my flesh.> Is this

\fac MM:  The Supyire says, "This bread is my flesh,
given for you.  Do this to remember me." .... We
have made explicit the, "Do this ..." and stated,
"Eat this bread."  We will add the phrase, "given
for you" to make it clear that Jesus is giving
himself, his body, for people. Otherwise, it is
worded the same as in the draft.
\fac MM1:  See proposed revision for this line.  It
would no longer match the Supyire NT draft
exactly.
\con DP Where there are comprehension and oral
reproducibility issues, it is ok to vary from the
NT translation here in lines 16 and 17 to this
degree.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Related to this, I'm also
wondering about the use of <bread>. Seeing
that Tst3 doesn't seem to say <bread>, makes
me wonder whether you would want to consider
going more generic here (e.g. took a piece of
the food / what they were eating...).
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Is bread a common staple of
the diet?  Or is it only brought from outside or
used on special occasions.  A way of testing this
might be something like <Why do you suppose
they were eating bread and not some other sort
of food?> or <Why do you suppose Jesus took
bread (as opposed to some other food)?>
\fac MM2:  Bread is common here.  It would also be
very appropriate for them to be eating bread
during a time of feast or celebration. There is
bread available daily here in town, and bread is
bought and brought into our village at least once
a week usually as well. Many other villages have
mud bread ovens that they make bread from.  It
would be difficult to go more generic because
generally "food" here would not have "'pieces"
nor would Jesus be able to "break" it and give it
to them.  The staple here is more of a playdo
type substance.  In other retellings, tst3 and the
final recording re-retelling from Tst2, the word
"bread" is retold repeatedly.

like my blood>, is this the same word as used

generic term now for <liquid>, and not just plain
water as opposed to <fruit water>?
\fac MM-F:  The word here for "water" is a generic
term for any kind of liquid with a water base.
The fact that he states "this water" makes it
clear within the Supyire language that it is
referring back to the water of fruit and
differentiates it from pure water.  This is
naturally how you would say this, repeating the
"water of fruit" a second time and referring to it
in "this water" terms.

actions to Jesus that he will die? Please clarify.
\fac MM1:  The meaning is that Jesus will die
"because of" or "for" their sins.  It is understood
and this is a common way of saying things.
\con LB re<I, Jesus, will die in the name of your bad
actions.  My blood will shed so that you can have

the Supyire  have a hard time connecting, as

have spelled it out here. -
\fac MM:  Yes, we will test further to see if it's clear.
\con LB re< so that you can have life forever> I see
that you spelled out, what TN suggests "for your
sakes". If you go specific, than I'd like to see a
connection made  to forgiveness.  "in the name
of your bad actions, so that your bad actions can
be forgiven." But I am not sure about including it
yet, at least not as a direct quote. So, don't
change it yet. I'll get back on that one.
\fac MM:  Okay, holding off on this - please let me
know if this needs changing.
\fac MM1:  Again, see further testing questions,
retelling notes, and proposed changes.  The
connections are being made now between Jesus'
death and the symbolism of the bread and
water.  Frankly, it is quite exciting to test these
stories in a more chronological manner (as they
are intended to be used) and watch as the
testing respondent grasps these concepts and
makes these connections, especially as Tst2
seems to be doing.
\con DP I'm really glad to hear this.  Thanks.

unpacking of  lines 20 and 21 <This is like my

will shed so that you can have life forever. When
I die, God's new alliance with you begins. That
is, if you believe in me, you will be saved. There
will be a good relationship between you and
God.>...
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  There is still one piece of
this that might go beyond the exegetical support
you've given from TN for the unpacking:
<...have life forever.>  I can see that it is
somewhat implied by the concept of being
<saved.>  But from what we've seen elsewhere,

at his "going away". So you might add
something  to say like "don't be surprised when I
leave.." This is how the CEV has it. "29 I am
telling you this before I leave, so that when it
does happen, you will have faith in me."

that it can also mean being anxious or tense. If

question, it can be reworded to state "Jesus
prayed seriously" or "Jesus really prayed" , as

\con DP With the testing response <Jesus was praying
with anger - anger, you know, when you do not
respond when someone is talking to you or when

be rephrased and made explicit here, "But this

owner of darkness is the opposite of God, is not
good, is not "light"; but as the original testor
stated, "I think this is Satan, but not everyone
would know that..."  the connection between "the
owner of darkness" and "Satan" may not be
easily made.  This connects with your previous

forced one, not simply walking behind him.
Question to ask: Why was he followed by these
bad people?
\fac MM:  Yes, it was clear in testing that these men
were "taken" with Jesus by force. They were like
criminals, having done bad things.
\con DP Ok, this is clear from testing as you say. 
This part <He was followed by two people who

\con DP re <God's Kingdom>, in the phrase <You are
going to be with me today in God's kingdom.>...
Is this the way the Supyire NT translation
expresses it in Luk.23:43?
\fac MM2: Supyire NT draft states, "Today, you will be
with me in paradise."  The word here used for
"paradise" has not been introduced into the story
set.  It is used in the Supyire NT draft in a few
places  (2 Cor 12:3 , Rev 2:7 , Luk 10:20 , Luk
16:22 - only places this word is used.)  This word
also carries much baggage with the Islamic
presence here.
\con DP2 Thanks for the info above.  Note the TH
comment in TW <'paradise', here of the place
where the redeemed are after death and before
the coming of the kingdom, best envisaged as
being in heaven...> .  Note also Marshall's
commentary for this anchor vs:  <The criminal's
petition expresses the hope that he will attain to
life at the parousia; Jesus' reply assures him of
immediate entry ...>.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) In other words it would be
important to express this differently than how
<kingdom> is expressed in line 22, in the words
of the thief <when you are in your kingdom>. As
supportable from various places in TN you could
say <in heaven (above)> or <in the place of
happiness / where we will be happy>.  So you
wouldn't have to keep the baggage of the term
<paradise>.
\fac MM3:  Could this then be changed to, "above
with me to God"?  Do you feel it would be a
worthwhile addition to also say, "the place where
those who have a good relationship with Him will
go when they die."  As TN also suggests, "This is
from the Greek word paradeisos, which refers to
a place of happiness where righteous people go
when they die."  It ties to the relationship theme,
but is somewhat wordy.  I would welcome your
thoughts here. Thanks.
\con DP-F Best to avoid the wordier adjustments
where possible.  Seems good what you suggest
in <MM**:  "God's Kingdom" here will be
changed to "you are going above with me to

\con DP-F BT line has <11 disciples> while the retold
story has <12 disciples>.  This is, of course, not
a huge theological issue.  But this sort of very
specific variance sets up a tolerance for revision
that is conducive to erosion that can impact
theological issues. Would it not be better to
generalize to just <disciples>?
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) I've searched for <11,
eleven, 12, twelve> throughout the story set. In
referring to the disciples this occurs in 40:02,
44:04, 50:05 (here) only. In none of these cases
does it seem that there is a major significance to
differentiating the group of 12 (later 11) disciples
from the larger group of less-close followers.

reference to the # of disciples removed.  See
updated BT.

\con DP Re <Tst3:  Why did they tell the disciples that
Jesus' body was not there?  Because the
disciples knew that Jesus said he would die and 3
days come back.  They knew this, but they didn't
know that Jesus had come back yet.>... This sort
of response occurs elsewere in this story as well,
(e.g. line 02 <They wanted to see his body
because he said he would come back from
death. >...
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  It raises the question as to
whether the omission of Luk.24:07 -08 leads to
an problematic understanding overall.  These vss
07 and 08 make it clear that the women (and
elsewhere, the disciples) had forgotten, i.e. did
NOT remember what Jesus had told them earlier,
that he would rise again.  Only after the angels
reminded them... <Then the women
remembered....> v8.
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  I'm hesistant to suggest
adding to a story that you are looking elsewhere
to shorten or simplify. But I'd suggest you test
this story again with a specific question (you
could go back to the same testing respondent,
just to ask this line of questioning...):  <Tell me
a bit more about what the women might have
been thinking when they went to the graveyard,
or more about why you think they went there?>
\con DP (CONTINUED...) If you don't get a clear
response, go ahead and ask specifically about
their responses earlier, reminding the testing
respondent of what they had said, and asking:
<Do you think they remembered what Jesus had
told them earlier about rising on the 3rd day?  Or
might they have forgotten that he had said
that?>  Please be sure with your intonation and
your way of asking the question that you don't
lead them to give the response that you would
know to be aligned with the fuller passage.  In
fact, if you lean in one direction on that, lean
toward leading them to the incorrect inference,
just to make sure they clearly correct it.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) If it turns out that the
understanding of the testing respondent is that
they remembered full well what Jesus had said,
and that they were going to see if he had come
back to life yet (i.e. what these responses seem
to be indicating), then you'll need to include
something of vss 7 and 8 that would make it
clear that that the rhetorical question <Why are
you looking for the live person from the dead?>
is actually a mild reprimand <Shame on you,
you have apparently forgotten what Jesus told
you earlier that he would rise again.  Otherwise
you wouldn't have come here looking for his
body at the place where dead people are
placed.>
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  If you determine from the
retelling testing that adding something would be
making an already too-long story that much less
reproducible, you always have the option of
splitting the story in two. That's actually a very
nice option.  A natural place to split this story
would be after line 09.
\fac MM1:  Upon retesting this story, it is clear the
testing respondent (Tst3) thinks the woman are
expecting to find the body of Jesus there. They
are not remembering that Jesus told them he
would rise.  However, you have brought up a
good point.  And to make this more clear, we
have added the phrase, "on Jesus' body" to line
02. Making it explicit that they were expecting to
find his body there.  See updated BT file for
retest questions and answers.
\con DP-F  I'd like you to put a note on the testing
question in this line of the BT file that cause my
query, and refer to the Tst3 retesting you
mention here as making it clear that they were
only expecting to find a dead body, and not
remembering Jesus told them he would rise.

peace"?  Because they knew him, they had
followed him and listened to his words - so he
told them to have peace - to take their

\con DP (CONTINUED...) From both the above
responses it seems to be the case that testing
respondents are not interpreting this as a very
normal way of greeting, but rather, as something
more unusual and content-oriented than it
actually was.  You could test this more explicitly,
with something like <When Jesus arrived to
where they were, how do you think he might
have first greeted them?>
\con DP (CONTINUED...) If you determine that this
<peace...> phrase is not being understood to be
a greeting, you could add something like <And
he greeted them as usual, saying "May God give
you peace">.

\con LB re<spoiled body> Is this the term used for
quickly decaying body? The text refers not to
them thinking that his body is decayed but rather
for them thinking he might be a ghost.
\fac kh:  in talking with our crafter, again, about this
word he still chose to go with the same original
word for "ghost".  I talked with him about this
using the French word for ghost and he really
seemed to understand.  There are many "spirit"
type things here in the world of the Supyire, and
when talking about this use of the word ghost he
feels like this the best choice, plus it is the word
used in tne NT draft.
\con LB1 I can't see that you have the word for ghost
in line 12. What I was commenting on was the
phrase <It is not a spoiled body.> CEV puts it
like this: "Touch me and find out for yourselves.
Ghosts don't have flesh and bones as you see I
have." So, could you change "spoiled body: for
"ghost" instead.
\fac kh1:  I entered a great explaination of the
Supyire term for "spoiled body" in the notes in
the BT.  The term "spoiled body" is used here for
the term we know as ghost.
\fac MM:  Another option here, would be to remove
the aspect of the "spoiled body" from the text
altogether.  Leave it with Jesus saying, "It's
really me." And him showing them his hands and
feet.  This would shorten the text; however, this
part has been retold well.  And it might be more
natural here, in this society, for their first
thoughts to go to "ghost" or "spoiled body".
\con DP With your explanation I expect it's ok as is
with "spoiled body".
\con DP Re <KH:  "spoiled body" is the Supyire use
for the word ghost.  It's a dead person's body.
The spirit is not dead.  It does not have arms or
legs, it does not have flesh and bone and cannot
eat.  It is not a demon or an angel.>... I'd
suggest you modify this to make it a bit clearer,
perhaps splitting it into two comments (...if I'm
understanding or interpreting the comment
correctly)...
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  First, something like <KH
"spoiled body" is the Supyire expression  for the
concept of "ghost".  It is the expression used in
the Supyire NT translation in this anchor vs for
"ghost".
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Second, in a separate line,
you could include the information <SOURCE????
[i.e. give the source here, like BK] A "spoiled
body / ghost" is said to be a dead person's body.
The spirit is not dead.  It does not have arms or
legs, it does not have flesh and bone and cannot
eat.  It is not a demon or an angel.>
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Then add another comment
like <KH Our understanding of the comment
above is that in saying <It's a dead person's
body>, it does not mean that this expression
"spoiled body" is referring to a decaying corpse
as opposed to the spirit / soul / ghost of the
person.  Apparently the two concepts are not
distinguished when a person dies, i.e. the
decaying corpse becomes the ghost.
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  If I haven't expressed this
as you understand it, feel free to rework what
I've written.  I'm simply trying to make sense of
the phrase that was giving LB (and me) pause
above, i.e. referring to a ghost as <It's a dead
person's body>, which on the face of it seemed
somewhat contradictory.  Have I understood the
situation ok?
\fac MM1:  David, I think this is more of a
backtranslation error than an issue of decaying
body vs. spirit/ghost of person.  In testing and in
asking the SIL team about this word, they
expressed it to mean a "ghost" or "spirit" of a
person who has died.  See tst3 responses.  We
will update the comment line accordingly.
\con DP-F That's not what I was hoping to hear (i.e.
that it was a "backtranslation error", as it would
have to be a worldview concept that is not
differentiating matter and spirit, in order for any
of this discussion to make sense to me, and for
the new retelling to come back with a line like
<A spoiled body does not have flesh and
bone>.  This is a matter on which I would
normally want to have a skype conversation or
at least im-ing, but I'm not sure that is possible
now.
\con DP-F On this topic, I think it would be worth
asking one of your testing respondents what
they think Jesus looked like when he appeared
to the disciples.  Do they envision him being
bloody and disfigured (and maybe even
beginning to smell)?  (The Luke story about
Jesus appearing to the two disciples on the road
to Emmaus, and them not recognizing him,
shows that he must have been fairly normal
looking.)
\con DP-F If the Supyire NT expresses this phrase <A
spoiled body does not have flesh and bone> with
the same words for <spoiled body>, <flesh>
and <bone> as in the newest retelling, then we'll
go with this as ok.  If not, then we need to talk
or IM.
\con DP-F Honestly, I think this may be OK as a
worldview concept matter, but I can't just accept
it as "backtranslation error", while your own
backtranslation of the same phrase in the
retelling does the same.
\fac MM-F:  From the first time our backtranslator
heard this, he did not know the word "ghost" in
English.  He used the phrase "spoiled body".
Since that time, we (Krystal and I) in our BT and
all testing comments have referred to this same
word as "spoiled body" in English (to make it
clear that this is the same Supyire word used in
Retellings and testing questions as in original
story).  The Supyire word remains the same;
however, our understanding of the word in
English is what has changed.  Even in the newest
retellings, we maintained the "spoiled body"
because this is an issue/word that has only
recently become clear that it's translation into
English is "ghost".  This is the same word as the
Supyire NT uses, the same word that has been
used in all retellings and in testing responses.
\fac MM-F:  We have also replayed the story and
retested it, and asked, "What do you think Jesus
looked like when he came back?"  He responded,
"He looked like Jesus.  He looked healthy.  They
were surprised only because they thought Jesus
was dead."

something to eat?  Because he was hungry. So
he asked for food and they gave him fish to eat. 
Then he ate it.  Because when you suffer you
become hungry or if it had been a long time
since he had eaten, you become hungry.>...
\con DP (CONTINUED)... note the following excerpt
from TN at vs 43 <Jesus was neither a ghost that
could not eat earthly food nor an ordinary man
who could be hungry (Plummer). He ate the fish
to show them that he had a body that could eat
physical food.>
\con DP (CONTINUED...) As you say, it would be ok to
omit this, if you think that's best.  Or in order to
retain it, since the testing shows its import to be
misconstrued, you could amplify with <And to
make them know that he wasn't a ghost, he said
"Give me something to eat", and he at it right
there in front of them.>  (and citing this excerpt
from TN in the anchor as your support.)
\con DP (CONTINUED...) To help you decide which
way to go, you might discuss it with one of your
testing respondent colleagues. If they see it as
clear and significant that eating something shows
he's not a ghost, then it could be good to retain it
with this amplification.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) If in the S worldview, a
"spoiled body / ghost" actually is thought to eat
food, e.g. the living relatives leave food for it to
eat (there are many cultures with this sort of
belief), then it would best be omitted.  In these
sorts of cases it could be very difficult to get the
average hearer to comprehend how a "spoiled
body / ghost" eating something shows that it's
not really a "spoiled body / ghost".  So best to
omit in that sort of case.

"should be handed over to the criminals hands"
out of here, leaving the elements you need

NT for repentence.  This is used several times
throughout the story set. However, we have
continually had problems with the retelling of this
phrase.  Is it time to switch to another way of
saying this? Something as proposed here in BT
file?
\con DP ok (very nice proposed revision)
\p
\con DP-F Latest retelling has <When his words were
finished he said...> rather than as the original
story has it <Many days later...>. Do you think
this might be because the testing respondent
was already familiar with the prior version of the
story, from your testing of it?
\con DP-F (CONTINUED...) Also, the phrase in this line
<You have seen me suffer, die, and rise from
death.>... in the retelling was part of the
previous scene when Jesus first appeared to the
disciples, and not in this new scene of the
ascension.  Is this possibly confusion being
carried over, you think, from the same testing
respondent being familiar with the prior version.

previous versions of the story not long before
this.

\con DP Re proposed anchors from Acts 1 in this and
following lines, it is problematic to portray
something that is described in Acts 1 (i.e. the
ascension) as if it were part of what happened in
the room where Jesus appeared to the disciples
immediately after his rising again.  If you are
going to use the Acts anchors and particularly
using those for the bit about the ascension, you
will at least need a transition to the ascension
events, something like <Days / weeks later,
Jesus appeared to them again and said...>
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Take a look at the Marshall
commentary for Luk.24:44 for a bit of discussion
about this transition.

going up into the sky. I like the part when Jesus

him leaving.">... What testing questions are you
thinking when you say this.  The one that says
<Where do you think Jesus goes?  The sky.
What's there? He is with God.>... seems to have
it understood well as it is.  Generally
amplification is warranted only when there is
some sort of comprehension issue without the
amplification.
\fac MM1:  In discussing with Krystal, the responses
given by Tst3, he seemed vague about what
Jesus was "doing" in the sky.  It seemed he
viewed Jesus as possibly "hovering" above
somewhere, waiting for when God would let him
go back down and be with his disciples.  Also,
while many Supyire believe "above" is where
God is, not all have this belief and not all would
automatically associate "Jesus going above" to
"Jesus is with God."  Therefore, we have unpack
this here.

\con DP For the L&C notes entry for {above} (i.e. the
key biblical concept for heaven), it would be
helpful for the entry to indicate whether in S
worldview, <Kile> is thought to reside in <neen
yingy na> or not.  In testing, such as in story
50.21b you got some indication that the
particular testing respondent understood Jesus to
be going to heaven where he would be with
God.  I'm not sure whether this was because of
this particular respondent's growing accurate
biblical worldview based on the stories or other
biblical input, versus whether a typical S person
from the core receptor community has the notion
that <neen yingy na> is where <Kile> is.
\fac MM2:  L&C Notes updated.
\con DP-F Regarding the discussion in the con notes
for story 50:21b where you said <Also, while
many Supyire believe "above" is where God is,
not all have this belief and not all would
automatically associate "Jesus going above" to
"Jesus is with God.">... this is a significant
enough notion that you should include this in the
L&C entry for "above" and note it as having been
significant enough as to warrant amplification in
that 50.21b story line.
\fac MM-F OK.  L&C Notes Updated.
\con DP-F2 ok
\p
\con DP (CONTINUED...) The reason for my wanting
this information is that for a key biblical concept
like "heaven", and generally for adequate
"coverage" (coverage of a biblically oriented
worldview), you would want to know whether the
use of the expression is bridging to an existing
worldview concept (heaven is the place of God
and other spirit beings, and place where those
who have died go to be with God), versus those
concepts being foreign / something new. If new
then you'd want to make sure that at some
place(s) in the story set it is included or inferred
from the testing.  Maybe you've done this -- it's
just that this would be helpful to have reflected
in the entry in the L&C Notes.

Does <meleke ni> have some other sense as
well?  Or does it literally mean <messenger>?

In tst 4, she omitted the phrase "no one goes

You may want to omit it, particularly with one of
the testing respondents not including it.  IVP and
TH in TW do make a bit of a point about it
leading to a deserted town (Old Gaza), and IVP
says it was "little-traveled", but it also says it
had plenty of Roman mile-markers, and it was a
way from Jerusalem to Egypt (which is of course
what this Ethiopian was doing on the road).  So it
may not be exactly right to say absolutely <no

everywhere for this sort of information.  LB or I
may have occasionally said something like <put

consistency, we'd prefer to see all of this sort of
information in a crafting note.
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  Comment lines are used by
some teams to put information that would be
reminders to themselves as to things still
needing to be attended to in revision.  Others
they can make up a new field marker for those

highlighted by means of a different font, so the

\con DP Re <Tst3:  ... How did the man know that
Philip could explain it?  Because he knew that
Philip was a disciple of Jesus.  He had been out
walking - giving God's Words.>... It is unlikely
that the African man knew Philip or knew that he
was a disciple of Jesus.  Marshall commentary in
TW for example says <He will have presumed,
perhaps from his clothing or accent, that he was
a Jew and therefore probably able to help him.>
\con DP (CONTINUED...)  You might go back to Tst3
(assuming that person is readily accessible to
you) and play the audio of this story again and
ask more questions on this part, like <You
mentioned before that this man knew that Philip
was a disciple of Jesus... How do you think he
knew that?>
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Depending on the response
you get, you may want to probe further to
determine if this notion stems from something in
the way the story is expressed.  You could ask
<What part of the story makes you think he
knew who Philip was?>
\con DP (CONTINUED...) If you determine that the
story does lend itself to this inference, see if you
can fix that in the story. The reason I am
pursuing this is that for the African to be seen as
knowing who Philip was, could in some way
diminish the extraordinary, totally miraculous
nature of this encounter.
\fac MM2:  We have returned to Tst3 and retested
this story.  See updated questions Tst3(retest). It
seems he does not have the notion that the
black man knew of Philip. However, if necessary
we could delete line 02b to lessen the emphasis
placed on the disciples walking around, to
decrease chances of someone thinking that
becaue of Philip's traveling around, the black
man had prior knowledge of him.  What are your
thoughts based on the new testing results?
\con DP-F ok as is 
\p
\ln 56.12
\con LB re<he opened> who does this refer to?
\fac MM:  Yes, we will make this line clearer in the
fact that after Philip got into the cab, the man
read part of God's messenger's Isaiah's paper.
\fac MM1:  See udpated BT.  
\con DP-F Re the new BT line <>, ... note the
following from TN for Act.08:32 <The tense of
the verb, for which the NIV has was reading,
indicates that he was reading when Philip met
him.>...  The way the new BT line sounds, the
black man newly starts to read this passage
after Philip gets up into the cab with him.  But
this is what he had been reading.
\fac MM-F:  Tense of verb has been changed to "was
reading".  See revised line.
\con DP-F2 ok
\p
\ln 56.13
\con LB re<parallel statement of "as a sheep being
led to slaughter"> It might be good to include
that part in your story, as the next line is talking
about being killed. That way the metaphor
-"sheep -slaughter" is clearly relating to his
death.
\fac MM:  Yes, good point.  We will revise this part to
include "like a sheep is led to be killed."  See
revised BT.
\con DP The Isaiah prophecy story 22 does not
contain this part or the proposed revision. So the
panorama is lacking a major cohesive element --
that of repeating the same part of the Isaiah
prophecy here in this story.  I realize you have
recently simplified the Isaiah prophecy story, but
in terms of overall reproducibility of the
panorama, having a repeated element like that
between the two stories should significantly
strengthen that.  Do you have any possibility of
someone doing a song for this particular line that
could become an integral part of the story?  That
would make it memorable.
\fac MM2:  Yes, the Isaiah 22 story will need to be
updated to include this phrase and cohesively
match it.  Unfortunately, we do not have
someone who is readily available to sing this
line, and this would probably not be sung
culturally, due to the nature of the content.
\con DP-F ok
\p
\con DP Re <Tst3:  Why did they lead him like a
sheep to the killing place?  Because when you
take a sheep, he doesn't talk - even when going
to the killing place.   Jesus , he didn't talk when
they took him to kill him either. >... the current
version of the Isaiah prophecy story doesn't
have this part about the sheep not talking.  Do
you think Tst3 got this from a previous version
of the Isaiah prophecy story?  Is it significant
that this is one of the elements that stands out to
him?
\fac MM2:  Yes, this testing respondent heard the
Isaiah Prophecy stories multiple times.  And yes,
he heard this portion from an earlier story about
the sheep not talking.  As far as the emphasis he
places on this, Tst2 states in questioning in line
14 that it is because "Jesus accepted/allowed
them and lowered himself to let them take him." 
(And this is again repeated at the end of file in
"Further Testing Comments Tst2), I believe this
is the more important aspect to maintain.  As
you are correct, Jesus does speak in the death
story.  But the important thing stressed
throughout the story set is that this is something
He is allowing to happen.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Or do you suspect that Tst3
knew the passage previously, so is not the best
UNS for these sorts of comprehension
questions.  The Death story doesn't have the
part about Jesus being quiet when interrogated,
and Jesus does say some things when
interrogated and when crucified in your Death
story.  So what do you suppose caused Tst3 to
supply this information?
\fac MM2:  No, this gentleman has not heard this
passage before, prior to our testing the story set
with him.  He simply has a good memory, as well
as the fact that we have been asking him many
questions about this and had heard the previous
versions of the story not long before.

\con LB re <explained that part and told him about
Jesus>  A further question to ask might be "Who
did the message about that sheep talk about?" If
it is not clear, you may have to unpack it further.
Like:  "...explained that part and told him about
Jesus. Jesus being the person talked about by
the messenger Isaiah.
\fac MM:  Yes, we will test this to make sure the
connection between the person Isaiah's talking
about and Jesus is clear.
\fac MM:  We tested this again.  Unfortunately the
group of men we normally test with were not
available (big voÃ¶doo fete).  We tested it with a
group of older women who had not heard
previous stories. They were unable to make the
connection here.  Would you suggest we go
ahead and make this totally explicit?
\fac MM1:  See updated BT line.   
\con DP I'm not seeing an updated BT on this line???
\fac MM2:  Yes, I apologize.  There is no updated BT
line because the connection was made clearly in
both Tst2 and Tst3 between the words of Isaiah
and Jesus.  This line did not need updating.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Regarding your question
above <Would you suggest we go ahead and
make this totally explicit?>... Hmmm, that's a
hard one.  Generally I would say that it would be
best to test with a group who had heard enough
of the stories that they could reasonably be
expected to make the connection.  So I would
not take the group of older women who hadn't
heard the earlier stories as a good test on this
particular question.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) The Tst3 respondent makes
the connection up at line 13 <Tst3: Who do you
think the part about the sheep is talking about?
Jesus - it was about Jesus, Jesus was like the
sheep.>  But see my comments about Tst3 up at
line 13, that Tst3's responses there make it
seem like he knew the content of passage
already, not just from the story.  Do you think
that's right?  Or have I missed something about
this?
\fac MM2:  No, he had no prior knowledge of Isaiah
passages before our story set.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) As you note at the bottom of
the file "further comments from Tst2", they say
<What do you like about the story?  ... the part
where Jesus made himself like a sheep, lowering
himself and allowing himself to be killed,>...
Assuming the person from the Tst2 group who
made this comment might be a good UNS, this
would be sufficient indication of a connection
being made, and would be indicative that you
wouldn't need to make it explicit.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) What about in the retelling of
Tst4?  Did she express things at any point that
made it seem like she grasped the connection?
\con DP (CONTINUED...) If any of these who are good
UNS candidates made even a weak connection,
you'd want to leave it implied, rather than
making it explicit with an amplification.
\fac MM2:  Yes.  That connection has been made and
we will leave line as is.

question.  They are actually not telling me what
is difficult for them to understand language or
story wise, within the story. Instead, they are
telling me what they do not like about the story. 
They do not like that the African cannot read and
understand the passage himself.  They do not
like that it is prophesized that Jesus must be
beaten and killed. But yes, we will clarify the
metaphor.   (A few of our initial testors
understood that it was Jesus they were referring
to).

used in the crafting sessions have been the

\con LB re<answer to your tst question> You are on
the right track about needing to clarify what the
"Good News" is about. That's why I had added
the question in line 1, to see their response. Your
phrase "telling about Jesus" is in line with TN,
which I include here for your consideration from
Acts08:04 05" and proclaimed the Christ there:
The tense of the verb, for which the NIV has
proclaimed, indicates that Philip began to tell
people and continued to do so. He was telling
them that Jesus was the Christ or “the Messiah,”
that is, the one whom God had promised to send
to them to save them. 8.58:5b and proclaimed
the Christ there. and he was telling the people
there that Jesus is the Messiah. "
\fac MM:  We will test what is understood to be the
"Good News" and then adjust as you have
suggested here to make it explicit that they were
telling people that Jesus is God's Chosen One or
the World's Savior.
\fac MM:  Based on testing, since they did not
conclude on their own that this involved Jesus'
disciples telling them that Jesus was the one
whom God had promised to send to them to
save them, we will make this information explicit
and remove the "Good News" term from our
story set.
\con DP Note also that the Key Biblical Terms
document in TW says this expression always has
the meaning in the NT of <the good news or
joyful report that God has made a way of
salvation for sinful human beings>.  As LB has
noted, it would be acceptable to flesh this out in
some way similar to this, or to part of it.  The
Tst2 responses seem to indicate that it is not
adequately understood to be as specific as this.

\con LB re<village> Is this the same term for town?
Please include in L&C note file. Could you include
a tst question here of "how big do you think
Philippi-village might be?"
\fac MM:  The word here is used as a generic place
marker in conversation to let someone know that
the Proper Name just said is a place.  It is used
if you are sitting at your hut/house and are
leaving to go buy something at a boutique, you
can say, "I'm going to town." It can also mean
village, but there is another Supyire word to
mean smaller village.  We will test and ask about
specifics of size.  This word can also be used
when addressing towns and cities.  See testing

tst question. The answer makes it sound almost
like an assumption that on the day of rest people

something that may not be supportable. From
what I've been able to see in the TW resources
the characterization is not that she had gone
there to the river on this particular day to
market her purple textiles, but that this was her
profession or trade generally.  Does the Supyire
NT translation or the French or Bambara express
it as what she was doing there by the river on
this particular day?

\con LB re<clothes> Could you clarify if the word is
for clothes or cloth/material?
\fac MM:  The word used here can mean both cloth or
clothing.  It is a generic word.  The vast majority
of clothes here come from buying an amount of
cloth in market first and then taking the cloth to
a tailor to fashion it into an "outfit". The word
here is not the word for "outfit" but for "cloth" or
"clothing" It's the same word as used in the
Supyire NT.

\con LB re<and Lydie accepted> Is this what the

"faith" or "believed" here." Could you please
clarify if it is a different word meaning the same
as "faith" or is it the same word back translated
differently? Please include in L&C note file.
\fac MM:  The word here is " nyee".  It literally means
to agree, or agree with, or agree that. It is the
same as the word used in the Supyire NT.  This
is a different word than the word for "faith";
however, it was explained that because she
agreed with what Paul was saying, she believed
in the words and had confidence in them.  The
two words are related, but not exactly the same.
We will add this to the L&C.

\con LB Re <opened her heart>, as this a literal
rendering of a figure of speech, I wonder
whether this is what the S NT has at this point?
\fac MM:  The S NT has this same figure of speech,
literally "open her heart".  There are a lot of
words expressing emotion and feeling that come
from the Supyire word for heart.  If you are
coveting something - you say your heart is bad. 
If you are honest and true, then it is said that
your heart is good.  If you are faithful and
steadfast, it is said that your heart was there.

\fac MM:  Yes, it is the same word for "to be saved"
as used in the Supyire NT.  See L&C Notes for
"save".  It is a form of this word.
\con DP2 Re <Tsts:  Based on retellings, the words of
the demon girl will be changed to, "These are
God's workers.  They are showing us God's
road.  These are God's workers.  They are
showing us God's road." (Note the Supyire NT
draft states it closer to the original phrase above
"showing us the way to be saved.">...
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) There are some further
things to consider here.  First, with the phrasing
you are thinking to use (God's workers, God's
road), it it still lacks the important sense of this
resulting in people being <saved>.  It would
seem that with your use of <Savior> as the
primary expression of the concept of <Christ /
Messiah>, that this should be able to figure in
somehow to what this slave girl is saying.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) I've looked back through
your BT files searching on <sav...> and find
your testing respondings (tst2, tst3, tst4) all
using the concept of <saving> in this
metaphorical, redemptive sense.  At one point
you even asked <what are they saved from>,
and the response was <from their bad things>
(several places in story 26).  So again, it would
seem that there should be some way of getting
the <save> notion in here as well in a way that
is orally reproduced in retelling.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) Literally in this part, the
slave girl is using the expression <way of
salvation>.  The <way> part of this seems very
akin to the <path / road> part of the expression
you are thinking to use. So that much seems
good.  And <God's workers>  seems good as
corresponding to <servants of ... God>.  It's just
that it is lacking the part about <...showing you
how God is going to save you>, or something
like that.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...)  The second thing to
consider in this discussion is that when the jailor
kneels down before Paul and Silas after the
earthquake, he uses this same <saved> sense.
Commentators generally consider that he
expressed it this way because of having heard
about Paul & Silas having been talking about this
<way of salvation>.  For example, the Marshall
commentary in TW at Act.16:30 says that the
jailer's...  <...question to them is surprising in its
immediate context, and can be understood only
in the light of the reputation which Paul and Silas
had gained in Philippi for their proclamation of
‘the way of salvation’ (verse 17).>
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) So if the story doesn't
likewise use some related <save> expression
when this jailer bows down before Paul and
Silas, you lose a very important connection.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) The <...find tomorrow>
expression that the SIL translators have gone
toward may be an important element in
expressing <salvation>, to make it clear that it
is salvation in a spiritual sense referring to a
future life in heaven.  If you were to retain some
expression of <save> (in order to relate
cohesively to your expression of Christ as
<Savior>, there where the jailer kneels down,
you could possibly use the two senses together
e.g. <What should I do for God to save me, so
that I find tomorrow>, or something like that.
\con DP2 (CONTINUED...) I'm assuming that the NT
translation retains the <save> notion in a
number of places.  You mention this one in
Act.16:17.  There are plenty of others, right?
\fac MM2:  Yes, you are correct.  There are
numerous other accounts of the use of the word
"save" in the NT draft.  We have done some
research and this verse and proposed a change
in the BT, keeping the wording of "save" by
trying it in a more natural form of the world.
\con DP-F Re proposed revision <MM** - In final
review, this should be changed to state, "These
are God's workers.  They have come to tell how
God can save us.">... seems good, we'll see how
it comes out in the recording.
\fac MM-F:  We worked and worked with this with the
craftor.  And this is what he concluded was the
most natural and was stated in a way in which
everyone would understand.  He said we could
not word it as we had previously proposed "tell
how God can save us"; this would not be proper
Supyire to word in this manner.  So he has
corrected our grammar mistake and reworded
as you see in the BT.

\con LB re<to be released from my sins?" Is this the
phrase Supyire NT uses in the story? And is this
a different phrase than "to be saved"?
\fac MM:  This is a different phrase than "to be
saved."  It literally means "to release/let go off
your wrong doings".  This was the phrase that
was being used in the Supyire NT draft.
However, they have recently revised this phrase
and changed it to read, "to find tomorrow".
Evidently, this is a well-known cultural phrase
that means "to get to heaven" or "to go to
paradise." Would you suggest changing to match
the Supyire draft here, or sticking with
something we have been using throughout the
story set, such as being saved or having sin
removed?  We will test as is and see what testing
results we get. See BT file for testing results.
\con DP Yes, it is messy when a key term is revised
like this.  I expect there were lots of good
reasons that the translation team revised it, so I
would probably suggest going with this new
expression as in the NT published version.
\con DP (CONTINUED)... Note that I've sent a
separate email asking about the "buy the head"
concept in the "Saviour" entry in L&C notes.  I'd
like to explore this with you a bit before
responding in a definitive way to your question.
\fac MM1:  See proposed change to this line to match
that of the Supyire NT draft.  I am still probing
for more on "buying the head of".  From my
understanding at this point in time, while the
word for "buy" and "save" are the same, it
depends on the context of how the word is used. 
To "buy someone's head" is only an expression
used for "convincing someone of something" and
is not related to "saving them from something." 
In my current understanding, based on
conversations with SIL team, this word has
multiple meanings based on context, but I will
ask further to see if these meanings are all tied
together as original L&C notes and keyterm list
suggests.
\con DP2 Re <saved> see comments above at line

\fac MM-F:  Our craftor insisted that these two
phrases would not be said together because their
meanings are the same.  It would not make
sense for the people to hear these two questions
together.  Therefore, he left it as you see in BT
file - tying in the "road to be saved" from the line

\fac MM:  Keyterm list has been updated since then.
\con DP Re <God's praying house>, the L&C Notes
entry for {house} mentions that this expression
is used in the Supyire NT translation for
<temple> (the building in Jerusalem), but does
not say whether it is what the translation used
for <synagogue> (the various local Jewish
worship houses) here in this particular anchor
verse.  It is probably ok to genericize terms a bit
in the story set (e.g. not to distinguish between
<temple> and <synagogue>.  But we'd want to
know how this relates to the S NT translation on
both counts.
\con DP (CONTINUED...) Also, your L&C Notes entry
discusses <church> in the same entry.  Could
you give an indication of what the S NT
translation does for this as well. Some
references for all three (temple, synagogue and
church) would be helpful in this L&C Notes
entry.  Thanks.

much a matter of importance to have the man's

than talking just about the "disciple", as this
brings futher questions, as to whose disciple this
