\t Senufo Supyire Project
\p
\co Senufo Supyire Cultural Background: The Senufo Supyire people are typically
farmers, living in close community with one another.  Everything is done in
community:  from farming, working the fields, to cooking rotations, to meetings, to
village decisions, to naming a child, to building a new village hut, to making tea -
there are few things in life here that is not done in fellowship of others.  A Senufo
Supyire proverb is "One finger alone cannot lift a pebble" ... "One hand cannot wash
itself."  Oftentimes, priority is placed on the relationship and not on a task or need of
an individual.  Much effort is placed in maintaining relationship, and in avoiding
breaking a relationship.  The Supyire people are typically animistic, African Traditional
Religion, and seek power in life through sacrifices to their intermediaries: spirits, or
fetishes.  While striving for power, daily life is spent struggling to meet their
everyday basic needs.  The power they are seeking is for provision in this life and for
the life after.
\p
\co Islam and Christianity Influence on Supyire Culture:  There are both Islam and
Christianity influences present within Supyire culture.  However, it appears that
even with the presence of these, they are typically only a veneer covering their
deeper traditional beliefs.  It is very common within the Supyire culture to participate
in the practices of multiple religions concurrently, synchronizing them or adding the
practice of Islam or Christianity to their current traditional beliefs and practices.  For
example, on one day, we witnessed a sacrifice to an animistic god with the
participation of our village friends.  These same friends then went to the mosque
and celebrated the Islamic religious holidays.  Also, it is apparent that geography and
location of each village is a factor in determining the level of Islamic or Christian
influence.  As there are several towns along the main paved road between the
capital and a second large city, these towns have drastically greater Christian and
Islamic influences.  There are more western-style buildings for worship as well as
greater communication available with telephone cabines, easier radio access, and a
constant flow of travellers.  However, the further away one travels from this main
road, the less Christian and Islamic influence is present.  There is a much greater
animistic present in the village where we spent the most time, only 12 km away
from the paved road, than in the main town where we lived.
\p             
\co Redemptive Themes:  
\co (1) Relationship.  Through belief in Jesus Christ, there can be a good relationship
between man and God.   
\co (a)  Problem:  When God created the world, there was a good relationship between
man and God.  This relationship between man and God was broken by the sins of
man.  Man is now cursed and will one day die and be judged by God.  Those who are
not on God's road, will be thrown into an a fire that cannot be extinguished.
\co (b) - Hope, Pointing to a solution:  There can be a good relationship between man
and God, through belief and trust in God.  There is someone coming, sent from God,
who will take the penalty for man's sin.  He will restore the relaitonship between
man and God.  He will save people from the fire that cannot be extinguished by
believing in Him.
\co (c) - Solution:  Jesus.  God's Son, Jesus, comes to save people.  He has been sent
by God to restore the relationship between man and God.  He suffered and died for
the sins of man.  He rose three days later and then ascended into heaven to be with
God.  Those who believe in Jesus, those who leave their old road and take Jesus'
road, can have a good relationship with God and be saved from the fire that never
ends, and be given life forever with God.
\co (d) Response:  The theme will call people to belief in Jesus.  It should call people to
be baptized to show that they have left their old road and taken Jesus' road.  God will
forgive their sins, restoring relationship with them, and offering them life forever
with Him.  The story set should show would those who are on Jesus' road, who are
in a restored relationship with God, should do:  be obedient to God, study His Words,
be in community with other believers, go and tell others.
\p
\co (2) Power and Provision:  Intertwined with the theme of relationship, is a subtheme
of power and provision.  God is the all-powerful victorious God who provides for the
needs of those that are in relationship with Him, that are on His road.
\co (a) Problem:  God created a world in which man was well taken care of and provided
for by Him.  However, as sin entered, the fallen world was a world full of evil and full
of hardship.  A world in which humans will one day die and face judgement and
anger from God.
\co (b) Hope, Pointing to Solution:  The story set shows that God can use His power to
provide for the needs of those who have a relationship with Him.  God has power
over nature, over sickness, over evil spirits.  God has power to give wisdom to
people and direct daily actions in a way the provides for them.  God is powerful, over
all other beings and things on earth.  God is a God who cares for the needs of His
people.  God will one day send a king, someone who will reign forever, be powerful,
and bring peace to people.
\co (c) Solution:  God's ultimate power and provision for those who follow Him was the
sending of His Son, Jesus.  Jesus and God are one.  Jesus has the power of God. 
Jesus died and rose again, conquering death.  Those who believe in Jesus have
access to God's Power through the coming of His Spirit.  Ultimately, God's power is
passed on to believers through victory over death and eternal life with God.
\co (d) Response:  This subtheme should call people to belief in Jesus, recognizing Jesus
as God's Son and as the all-powerful provider because He has provided a way to gain
eternal life with God, power over death, provision for this life and after.

\co Comment on availability of scripture in mother-tongue language:  An SIL team has
been working on the translation of the NT.  There has been an electronic draft of the
NT available for use and reference during this project. The NT was printed as of Oct
08 and distributed Dec08. There is also a draft in progress of Genesis, parts of
Exodus, and Ruth.
\p
\co There has been an SIL presence in the ethno-center of the Supyire people for 20+
years.  Outside of the NT draft, several products have been written regarding the
Senufo Supyire culture and language.  Michael Jemphrey‚Äôs thesis, ‚ÄúThrough the
shedding of blood‚Äù, and the Supyire - Lexique Pro Dictionary by Robert Carlson
proved to be valuable resources during language and culture study and research.
\p    
\co The Story crafter we have been working with is a believer named Sitapha.  He also
works as a night guard and office worker for SIL, and is often a worship leader at the
church we attend.  He and his family live in the same town where we live.  = SS.
\p
\co The backtranslator for the project is a young educated man who came back from
college in Bamako to work as a head master of a school in the city nearest to our
town.  He is not a Christian; however, he openly discusses the beliefs and culture
around him.  = BK.
\p
\co Typical Testing Groups Throughout Story Set:
\co Language Helper in Village:  This was our first testing group for all stories.  Our
village language helper (for language learning) is a 25 yr old male, has some
education and spent some time in the nearby city, but has lived the most recent
part of his life in the village.  He has recently become a bptzd believer.
\co Group of Women in Village:  This group varies, and sometimes is combined with the
testing session with our language helper.  These women are highly oral learners,
most are uneducated, all are UNS.  They primarily practice animism.
\co Group of Men in Nearby Village:  This is a testing group of between 5-10 men who
are predominately animistic or African Traditional Religion, all are UNS.  Some do
practice Islam as well.  This group has varied in attendance, but has had a
consistant group of 4-5 hearing most stories.
\co Day Guard friend:  This is a young educated male who works as a day guard in our
town.  He is a UNS.  He has told us that this is the first time he has heard these
stories.
\co Woman Friends at Boutique:  These are two women who work at a local store in
town.  They are both UNS.  The two of them often rotate work duties at the store,
however, at least one is usually available for story testing.
\co Phone booth friend:  A woman friend of ours who is readily available for testing as
she works at a phone cabine here in town.  She is married into a Muslim family;
however, she has attended church here in town a few times.  Many of the stories,
she is hearing for the first time.  She was a testing respondent primarily as a source
for story retellability and not for worldview probing questions, as she has the most
Christian influence of our test groups.

\t Creation - New
\co Supyire
\p
\co Redemptive Theme:  This initial story shows God's power over all by creating all
things.  The story shows God's provision for man and good relationship with man in
the beginning.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  God is maker of all heaven and earth.
\co Cohesion / Background:  This initial story sets the stage prior to a problem.  The
story also sets up the future problem by introducing the one tree that gives
knowledge of good and bad that man and woman were not to eat of.
\co Worldview / Selection Issues :  As most Supyire believe in a Creator God, this story
should serve as a bridge.

\tst General Testing Comments:  Tst3 = One gentleman, day guard, NGo.  This was the first
time working with our friend.  Some of the details of the creation of the things on earth
were omitted, potentially because of this first time working with him, not knowing what to
expect, and performance error.  See specific line number for further detail.
\p
\tst General Testing Comments:  Tst2 = Group of men and one woman at a boutique in
town.   The retelling of the story has gone well the several times this new version has
been tested.  Sometimes a few of the details of what was created when gets out of order
chronologically.  The details of how the man and woman were made are retold well.  The
simplification of the part in which God placed them in a garden, and told them they could
eat of the fruit of all the trees except one ... this part was clear, understood, and retold
well.  It was emphasized and the connection between this and the Fall story was made
well.  It was also understood that life in the garden was good - there was a lot to eat
there.    Overall, the testing sessions and retellability went well.
\p
\tst Tst3 (retest):  Upon editing and revising, the story was tested again, both for retellability
and to probe a few issues further.  See comments below.
\tst Tst5 - Tested a few further probing issues with friend at phone booth.  
\p
\ln 01.01
\bt This is something that happened which is also true.
\anc 2Ti.03:16 , Psa.119:142 (New Century Version) "...your teachings are true";
Psa.119:160 (NIV) "all your words are true"; Jhn.17:17 "your word is truth".
\cn MM:  This is a typical introduction to our stories.  This seems to be a culturally
appropriate way to introduce a story and to set this story apart as a true story rather
than a fable or cultural story that may be untrue.
\ln 01.02
\bt Before the beginning of the {world}, {God} was there.
\anc Jhn.01:01 - 2 ; 1Ti.01:17
\cn MM:  Here is the first reference to the key term God.  This term is used throughout the
story set and will not be bracketed in future references.
\tst Tst3: Before the world existed, what do you think was there?  God.  God only.  People
here think that God created the world and put people on it.  People think God created the
earth, animals, trees, people.
\tst Tst3: The initial line of the story, line 02 was omitted in the retelling.  He made an initial
statement to say "God gave these words about the world.  God created the world."  The
word he used here in the retelling is the word that is inclusive of the earth, heavens,
land, water, animals, and all things on the earth.  It may be a good idea to simply add
this statement after or in conjunction with the current line 02.  "Before the world, God
was there.  God created the world."  Line 01.02b added.
\ln 01.02b
\bt God created {KT: create} the world.
\anc Gen.01:01
\ln 01.03
\bt God created the heavens [KT: {above}], created the {earth}, and
created the water.
\old Then God created the earth and [created] the water, and created the above.
\anc Gen.01:01 , Gen.01:02 , Gen.01:09 - 10 , Job.38:08 -11 , TW: The heavens and the
earth is the Hebrew way of speaking of all that existed. It is an idiom made up of two
opposites, like the expression ìgood and evil,î and in this context it means the universe,
or everything in the universe, and not just the earth and the sky.  Therefore, water was
included in this.
\cn MM:  The word for "earth" here, which is the same word used in the Supyire draft,
means literally dirt or ground.  It does not include water. Therefore, when it says God
made the heavens and earth, it is not clear that He put the water on earth.  It is made
explicit for this reason.
\ln 01.04a
\bt Darkness covered the world.  
\old And let all the kinds of trees to rise on the earth.
\anc Gen.01:02
\tst Tst3(retest):  In final retelling, he states, "Darkness was there."  We discussed this
concept further with individuals and they explained it as the whole world was in
darkness.  The whole world was dark.  As this expression is understood, it will not be
changed.
\ln 01.04b
\bt And God said, "Light come."  And the light came.  
\anc Gen.01:03
\ln 01.04c
\old When God saw the light, he said, "It is good."
\anc Gen.01:04
\tst Tst2:  Why does God say "It is good" when He sees the light?  It was dark all over
before.  Now it's light.  Everything becomes clear and bright.  It is a good thing for
everyone to have light.
\tst Tst3:  In multiple testing sessions, as well as this one, this line was omitted.  This line
may be cut from the story set as it is difficult to retell.
\tst Based on retellings, this line has been deleted.  
\ln 01.05
\bt God said, "All kinds of grass, all kinds of trees, grow on the earth."  
\old And created light and [created] the darkness
\anc Gen.01:11 - 12
\ln 01.06a
\bt God created the sun, created the moon, and created the stars.  
\old And created the moon and the sun, and [created] the stars.  And created all the animals.
\anc Gen.01:14 - 18
\ln 01.06b
\bt God created all the birds, the fish, the field animals, and all the
animals.  
\anc Gen.01:21 - 22 , Gen.01:24 -25
\tst Tst3:  In the retelling, he chronologically mixed up the creation of the grass and things
on the earth with the calling of the light to come.  He omitted the details of the creation
of the animals, birds, etc.. and simply said "all things on earth."  He also  left out the
creation of the sun, moon, and stars.  However, in the multiple other re-tellings these
details were included.  Being the first time working with Tst3, these omissions were most
likely performance error and do not warrant a change in story text.
\ln 01.06c
\bt And God looked at the world and said, "It is good."
\anc Gen.01:10 , Gen.01:12 , Gen.01:18 , Gen.01:21 , Gen.01:25
\tst Why did God look at the world and say "IT's good."?  God knows that His work is good.  
\tst Tst2:  Why did God say "It is good" after he looked at the world?  Because He put the
light there.  He made the birds, the animals, the fish, the grass, the trees - all of this is
good.
\ln 01.07
\bt One day, He took the mud and built it into a human being [MM gave it
the shape of a person], and blew breathing-air into his nose.
\anc Gen.02:07
\cn MM:  The term used and backtranslated here as "mud" is the same term used in the
Senufo draft of Genesis.
\tst Tst2:  Why does God make man?  He wanted people on the earth.  Also, it's like, I am
sitting here alone - that's not good for me.  I want you to come and be here with me -
when you are here, it's good for me.  (companionship is good).
\tst Tst2:  How does God blow air into the man's nose?  God blew air into him to give him
life.  He blew air into him so that the man could start respiration.
\ln 01.08
\bt And it became a person.  His name was Adam.
\old And it became a person.  He named him Adam.
\anc Gen.02:07 , Gen.02:20 , as in TN in Gen.03:20 states, "As mentioned in the note on
3:17a, the Hebrew word 'aDam can be translated as ‚Äúman‚Äù or as the name ‚ÄúAdam‚Äù.  
English translations of Genesis vary somewhat as to when they transition from
translating the Hebrew word "Adam" as "man" to translating it with the name "Adam".
\tst Why did God make man?  To do His work.  To work.   
\tst tst3:  He omitted the name of the man in retelling, which was unusual.  This has been
retold in every other retelling.  So, we will not make any changes based on this one time
event.
\ln 01.09
\bt Then He let him in a garden he had created
\old And [MM: God] let him [MM: the man] in the {garden}.
\anc Gen.02:15
\tst Tst2:  What is in a garden (chee-ckworray)?  Lots of trees.  Trees are everywhere.  Like
a plantation or garden (plantation and jardin in French).  It is a really good place.
\tst Tst2:  Why does God let the man in the garden?  There are lots of trees there - fruits are
there.  They can eat all the fruit except one tree.  It's good that the man is in the garden
because there is food to eat.
\ln 01.10
\bt There were all kinds of trees in that garden.  Their fruits were pretty.
\anc Gen.02:09
\tst Was God good to the man?  Yes.  Why?  Life was good in the garden.  There was lots to
eat there.
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, Line 10 was omitted and it jumped straight from putting man in the
garden, to God telling man he could eat of all the fruits of all the trees except one. 
However, this line has been retold in every other retelling.  It emphasizes the goodness
of the garden and shows the care in which God went to to place the man in a good
environment.  This line will not be cut, also based on the fact that the explicit statement
that "life is good in the garden" in Line 20 may be deleted.
\ln 00.11
\bt Then God said to Adam, "You can eat all the fruit except one tree"
\old And told Adam that he can eat all the fruits in the garden, but there is one tree he should
not eat the fruit of.  He will die the day he eats it.
\anc Gen.02:16 - 17
\tst Tst2:  Why is there one tree that the man cannot eat the fruit of?  He will die if he eats
it.  But this is a question that the man (one of the test group men) asked himself, "Why
would God say he could not eat of that fruit?")  They said that the answer to this question
was not told in this story.  They did not further comment on what they thought a possible
answer might be.  Also, as far as learnability is concerned, our language helper has now
heard this version of the story several times, and retells it often (often times he corrects
me if I get something out of order or my Supyire is not absolutely correct).  So it is
learnable.
\tst Tst3:  Why is there one tree that the man cannot eat the fruit of?  God told the man he
could eat all the fruit of all the tree, except that one.  Why would God say that he could
not eat the fruit of that tree?  God gave them all the other fruit of all the other trees to
eat, but that one is His tree.  It's His tree.  He gave them everything.  They could have
everything, but that one tree was His.  Why do you think the man will die if he eats that
fruit?  God said he would die.  Why do you think this is?  God said if they ate the fruit of
that tree they would die.  People would die and all people would be finished.  God did not
want people to be finished, but He created them and would kill them if they ate the fruit
of that tree.
\tst Tst3:  Is the fruit of the tree poisonous?  Yes.  If they eat it they will die.  Who made the
tree?  God made the tree.  Why would God make a tree with poisonous fruit on it?  God
made the trees.  The trees are good.  Some trees just have poisonous things on them
that people cannot eat.  People should trust God's words, but everybody does not trust
God's words.  He tells them not to eat the fruit of that tree, if they trust Him, they will not
eat it.
\tst Tst3 (retest):  Talk to me about the trees in the garden.  God created them all for them
to eat of.  God is their boss, their leader.  He gave them an entire garden of trees to eat
from.
\tst Tst3 (retest):  This one tree is there that they cannot eat from.  Why?  He wanted them
to know that he was their God, their chief.  He blessed them and gave them the entire
garden.  He wanted them to fear and respect Him because He is God.  That tree would
kill them.
\tst Tst3 (retest):  Why would He not want them to eat from this tree?  Because it was God's
will for them to not eat the fruit of that tree.  If they ate the fruit of that tree, they would
die.
\ln 01.12a
\bt If you eat the fruit of that tree, you will know good and know bad {KT:
sin}.
\anc Gen.02:17 , Gen.02:09 , TN states, " That is, ‚Äúthe tree whose fruit causes people who eat
it to know good and evil‚Äù
\tst Tst3(retest):  Why does God not want them to know good and know bad?  Because he
does not want them to know, it is not good for God if they know good and bad.  God told
them not to eat the fruit of this tree, he told them not to because he doesn't want them
to know things, to be scared, and to die.  God helped them.  He gave them an entire
garden to eat from, but this one tree was His tree.  You came on your motorcycle. If you
told me not to touch it, I would not because you told me to.  Does this make someone's
insides bad?  Does this make God bad?  No.  It is just what God told them to do.  It was
His tree and He told them not to eat of it.
\tst Tst3 (retest) : in retelling, this new added line was retold.  
\tst Tst5:  What kinds of things do you think he might know about that would be bad?  They
will know death, suffering, tiredness.  Bad is when their work is bad or they have
accidents.  Or they are bad.  It could be when you wake up without food and water,
when you don't have food to eat at meals.
\ln 01.12b
\bt If you eat the fruit of that tree, you will die.
\old You will die the day you eat them.
\old There were these two trees in the garden.  One was the tree of knowing good and
knowing bad.  The other one was the tree of life.
\tst How did the man know not to eat the fruit of one tree?  God told him.  
\anc Gen.02:17
\cn In testing, it was still misunderstood and unclear.  The trees are confusing, their names
are confusing.  We have simplified this part of the story.  The point is clear that they can
eat of all the trees in the garden, except for one tree.
\old 02.13
\old And asked him not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowing good and bad.  He will die when
he eats it.
\old Gen.02:16 - 17
\cn Line 13 has been deleted.
\ln 01.14
\old And let him to take care of the garden.
\anc Gen.02:15
\tst What kind of things will he do in the garden?  He is the guardian of the garden.  He will
take care of it.  He will farm. 
\ln 01.15
\bt One day, God said, "It is not good to let Adam alone.  I am going to
make him a helper who's going to be fitting for him."
\old One day, God said, "It is not good to let Adam alone.  I am going to give him a helper
who's going to be himself."
\old One day, he noticed [MM: saw] that it is not good to let Adam alone.  That he's going to
give him a helper.
\anc Gen.02:18
\cn MM:  Here the phrase "fitting for him" is what is used in the Supyire Genesis draft.
\tst Tst2:  Why does God say it not good for Adam to be alone?  God wanted someone to
help work with Adam.  The world can not be full of people without the woman.  Without a
wife, it's just him.  That's not good.
\tst Tst2:  How will a "helper be himself"?  God will give the man another to help him.  This
other will be one that is like him.  How is this helper like him?  He is like him.  (This
phrase was just reiterated.)  Who would someone like him be?  The woman is someone
like him.  (comme lui in French)
\tst Tst3:  Why is it not good for man to be alone?  It's not good to be alone.  It's not good to
work by yourself.  He needs a helper.
\tst Tst3:  What does it mean that "to be himself"?  It means the helper will be like his family
and do the work of his family.  For example, this man is a Sanogo (His family name is
Sanogo) and comes from this "Sanogo home".  God made a "Berte" (the man's wife's
family name) to join him and help him to do his work.
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, in line 15, he did not word the phrase "who will be himself" phrase the
same way, but basically said the helper will be "like him".  This may be a better way to
state this.  However, this also does not coincide with the Supyire draft.  Based on the
fact that the phrase the craftor has used does not seem to be any more re-tellable than
the Supyire draft phrasing, we will match that of the draft to state that God will give him
a helper who will be "fitting/suitable" for him.
\tst Tst3 (retest):  In retelling, he now matches the revised "fitting for him" phrase.
\tst Tst5:  When someone is fitting for you, how would you describe that person?  He said
that about Awa because she was good for him and came to help him in the garden.  She
came from his rib.  She was good for him because it is not good  to be alone.  My
husband would say that about me because I help him and work for him.  I am fitting for
him.  What ways might they be fitting?  She came from him, they are one.  She was his
to help him because it was not good for him to be alone, so God made her from his rib. 
She will live, and eat, and learn together and this is how they are fitting.

\tst How did God make woman?  He made Adam asleep.  He took one of Adam's ribs.  He
made a woman from it.  
\tst Why did God make woman?  God said it's not good for man to be alone.  To help the
man.  "To cook for him".  To be his friend.
\tst Tst3 (retest):  He introduces the woman and then says, "He named her Awa".  As it
seems more natural in story telling to introduce the names of characters early on, this
would be a more natural place to state, "Her name was Awa".  See lines in 02.19 - as
these phrases have been omitted in retellings, the naming of Awa in this story will be
deleted.  Therefore, her name can be introduced here.

verses, "The loving Creator could not overlook their disobedience, nor could he leave
quivering sinners in their poignant need. They were his own. His holiness must come,
clothed with love, to seek, find, and judge them. ... Of course God knew where the man
and woman were. But he was appealing to them, seeking through tenderness and love to
win a favorable response." 
\anc Gen.01:26 -30  "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"  The
Wycliffe Bible Commentary, Electronic Database states in regard to this verse, "It is

created. He stood on a much higher plateau, for God created him to be immortal, and
made him a special image of His own eternity. Man was a creature with whom his Maker
could visit and have fellowship and communion."

\t The Fall Story
\co Supyire
\p
\co Redemptive Theme:  The story shows the need for restored relationship with God as
now the good relationship has been broken by the disobedience of man.  God's
power is seen as he removes sinful man from His provision in the garden and curses
man to a life of hardship and death.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  Sin is disobedience to God's instruction.  There are
consequences to sin - the breaking of relationship between man and God.
\co Cohesion / Background:  The story continues with man and woman in the garden
from the previous story.  Cohesive use of tree that gives knowledge of good and bad
as woman eats the fruit because she wants to be intelligent like God.  Sin's
consequence  is cohesively defined in terms of the redemptive theme of
"relationship".

\bt This is something true that happened, 
\old So, the animals and birds that God created were not as cunning as the snake.  The
snake was the most cunning.
\anc 2Ti.03:16 , Psa.119:142 (New Century Version) "...your teachings are true";
Psa.119:160 (NIV) "all your words are true"; Jhn.17:17 "your word is truth".

\anc GEN.03:01
\anc Anchor for "letting them in the garden" : Gen.02:15
\tst How was the snake the most cunning?  he was the most intellegent of the animals but
Adama was still over him, 
\cn MM:  Here, the word "cyiige" is the term used in the Supyire NT & Gen drafts as
"cunning".  It means to be clever, smart, aware.  "When a child is smart lots of things
stay in his memory."  It can also mean, to make intelligent, "I made the child
intelligent."  it can also mean "to tip someone off, example: the guards had installed
themselveds on the road he was taking so i tipped him off and he went back."  We have
seen this word used to describe a person who is trying to take advantage of a person or
family.
\ln 02.02
\bt Then one day the snake went to the woman.  It wanted to trick her,
and asked her, ‚ÄúIs it true, that God has said you can not eat the fruit
of the trees?"
\old Then one day the snake went to the woman and asked her, ‚ÄúDid God ask you not to eat
the fruit of all the trees?" 
\anc Gen.03:01
\tst How could the snake talk?  Because he was the msot intellegent of the animals, he
wanted to be over them over the whole world
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he left out the detail of the actual diaolgue, 02.02, of the snake asking
the woman what they could eat, but said, "The snake went to the woman in the garden
and asked her what she could eat."  However, because the remainder of the diaolgue
between the woman & snake was told well, and this was told in previous retellings, the
direct dialogue will be maintained here.  He is using the same terms we use in the story.
\tst Tst2 (retest):  In retest, again, he does not say "Did God ask.." , but states, "Can you
eat..."  This may stem from a mistunderstanding that the snake is actually not trying to
trick or deceive the woman, but is simply smart and is telling the truth here.  This
deception of the snake may need to be made explicit by stating, "One day, the snake
went to the woman to trick her and asked her, "Truly, did God ....?"  (Match Supyire
draft here).  Revised.
\ln 02.03
\bt Then the woman answered, "We can eat the fruit of all the trees in the
{garden}, except one tree.  God said, the day we eat that fruit, we will
die.
\old Then the woman answered, ‚ÄúNo.  We can eat all the fruit but there is one tree in the
{garden} that we should not eat the fruit of.  That the day we eat the fruit, we will die."
\old Then the woman answered, ‚ÄúNo.  We can eat all the fruit but there is one tree in the
middle of the garden that we should not eat the fruit of.  That the day we eat the fruit,
we will die."
\anc gen.03:02 -03
\tst How will they die?  it is God's power over them, they turned against God, he gave them
the whole garden to eat from but they cannot eat from the one tree
\cn To coordinate with the creation story "in the middle" has been removed because in both
stories it was not understood and added more confusion than aid to the understanding of
the trees in the garden.

\tst Tst2:  How did the snake know they would not die?  Because he was made more
intelligent than all the other animals
\tst Tst2 (Retest):  How did the snake know they would not die?  Because he was the
smartest of all the animals.  God made him that way.  The snake knew that they
wouldn't die, but that they could be like God, knowing good and bad, really smart.  He
knew they wouldn't die.  Why does the snake say this?  Because he was smart, God
must have told him this.   How do you know or why do you think God told the snake
this?  I don't know.

\old Then the woman noticed that that is true because the fruit is very nice/beautiful and if
you eat the fruit you will become really intelligent.
\anc Gen.03:06
\tst Tst2:  How could eating beautiful fruit make you more intelligent?  Because it was from
God's tree.  After they ate the fruit and it was in them that is when they knew they did
not have clothes on, it did make them more intelligent they knew they didn't clothes and
then they had to make them.

\old She picked up one and gave one to her husband and they both ate the fruits. 
\anc Gen.03:06
\cn MM:  "cut" is the same word as used in the Supyire Genesis draft.
\tst Why did she give fruit to her husband?  Because she wanted to be intelligent and be over
him.
\tst Why did he eat the fruit?  He knew what she was giving him because he said this was the
fruit that God told them not to eat, but she told him to eat the fruit from that tree so they
would be more intelligent, but they were tricked (the speakers explained that they even
while it was not said in the story that the man knew which fruit it was because he was
there when God told them not to eat it)
\ln 02.07
\bt When they ate the fruit they noticed that they were naked 
\anc Gen.03:07
\tst How did they know they were naked?  Because they ate the fruit God told them not to
and then they knew that their clothes were lost to them
\tst Tst2 (retest):  How did they know they were not wearing any clothes?  When they ate
the fruit they became really smart and they knew they weren't wearing any clothes.  So
after that, they knew they were not wearing any clothes, they got fig tree leaves to
make clothes for themselves, they just knew they weren't wearing any clothes.

\cn MM:  "Faanna" is the term used in the Supyrie draft to mean to trick, decieve, or tease.
For example, "He thinks they are serious but they are teasing him." or "Money does not
deceive anyone." -meaning it is what it is.  This is the term used in the Gen draft 02.14.

life and is going to eat the mud." 
\anc Gen.03:14
\cn MM:  The term for "curse" is in both the supyire draft & our story, see keyterms.
\tst How did God curse the snake?  he did it because of the bad he did, he will have no feet,
he will crawel on the stomach all his life
\tst Here in Mali how are curses used?  For example if your child is sick and you go to get a
blessing to make him better but he does not get better someone has given you the
opposite of a blessing on him and cursed him.  When bad people do bad things and they
get bad back.

offspring find you, it is going to break your head."
\anc Gen.03:15
\tst Tst2:  How is there still nastiness between the woman's offspring & the snake's
offspring?  Even today the snake comes up behind when you are in the field working and
bites at your heel.  But then we kill the snake.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, this is an area that he confused the order on, the curses from 02.16 -
02.18 and added a line that I am really not sure what it means, between the curse of the
snake and the others.  In 02.16 he did not include the part of the curse about the woman
having difficult childbirth & her desire to be on top of her man, basically all of 02.17.  It
is interesting here, that as a male, he does not retell parts of the curse on the woman
very well, but does get every detail of the curse on the man.  Our female friends who
have heard the story, have retold every bit of this curse on the woman, but omitted
portions of the curse on the man.  Based on the fact that it seems different parts of the
curse has more personal importance/meaning than others, it will be left in as is.
\tst Tst2 (retest):  In retesting, he retold this and it will remain as is.      
\ln 02.17
\bt He said to the woman, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you suffer a lot when giving
birth.  You will suffer a lot.   You would like to be the boss of your

\old He said to the woman, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you suffer a lot when giving birth.  You will
suffer a lot.   You would like to be on top of your husband, but you can‚Äôt.  Your husband
is going to be on top you during all your life."
\anc Gen.03:16
\cn BK explained during backtranslating that "to be on top of your husband" literally means
that she will want "to guide/to be the boss" or to be over her husband's authority
\tst Why is the husband over her?  maybe she thought that if she ate it she could be over
him but she never will be, she would like to be over her man but never will be
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, while he did not include all of this line, he later related how the way
the curse is said in the story is still the way it is today, stating how it's hard to give birth
for women and the snake is always still attacking the woman's heel. (In some of our
women's testing they retold the part about chirldbirth & the desire for woman to be on
top of her man easily.
\tst Tst2 (Retest):  This line was retold in this retelling and will remain in the story as is.    
\ln 02.18
\bt Then God said to the man, ‚ÄúI am going to make the ground hard.  You
will work hard and you will suffer to grow food to eat."
\old Then He said to the man, ‚ÄúYou are going to eat from the sweat of your forehead, [KH:
You are going to eat from your sweat], you are going to cultivate the land, where there
will be weeds.
\anc Gen.03:17 -18
\tst What will the land be like that he farms?  It is not good because when you are working
and your good growth is coming in the weeds are there and they take over and make for
more work, weeds are everywhere on the farms.

\bt From this day on, humans will die.  From the dirt I made you, you will
return to this dirt when you die.
\old You are going to eat [kh: live] by the sweat of your forehead [KH: your sweat] until your
last day.  You will return to the same earth you are from."
\anc gen.03:19
\cn The Supyire word for "weeds" is a generic term for grass, weed, seemingly anything that
can't be eaten and that is bad for a farmer.
\cn KH:  In testing, back-translating, & crafting when trying to get the specifics of this verse
we were given the word for "weeds".  We have pointed out physical examples of thorns
in these situations, and the generic word for "weeds" is given.
\tst How did God punish the man?  He will have to work hard & sweat for his food, that he
came from earth and one day when he dies he will go back into the earth
\tst How does someone "eat from the sweat of your forehead"?  It means that you will have
to work a lot of difficult work to have food to eat.  Everybody knows you have to work to
eat and when you sweat it is from working hard, not sitting. (When talking about this the
speaker acted out wiping sweat from his forehead several times and said only when you
work hard you sweat like that.)
\tst Tst2 (retest):  In retellings, the curse was in question ... Is the curse reproducible? 
Based on this retest, it seems the curse of the man needs simplifying.  The other curses
are retold well.  However, this line will be simplified.  "I will make the ground hard.  You
will have to work hard and suffer to grow food.  > From now on, humans will die.  I
made you from dirt, you will return to dirt when you die."  This also builds the problem
created by sin - now humans will die.  And emphasises the fact that the snake was
tricking the woman.  Revised.

\old Then Adama named the woman Awa.  This means living.  {Why?}  Because she is the
mother of all the persons of the world.
\anc Gen.03:20
\tst Why does everybody know   Awa's name is big (famous), because she is the mother of
all the earth.  everybody know Awa.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he omitted the naming of the woman & her name's meaning. 
However, this has been retold well in other tellings.  Interesting to note the differences of
importance of parts of the story to a male and to a female.  All of our female testing
respondents that have heard the story have included this in the retelling.
\tst TSt2 (retest):  In retelling, this is placed chronologically out of order.  A line is also
added stating that there was a good relationship between man and woman .... this is
inaccurate.  This could be a distraction from the story flow and could be deleted from the
story.  The woman's name could be added to the creation story, as Adam's name is.

\anc gen.03:23
\cn MM:   Here, the word "chased" can also be expressed as "kicked out" or "to make
something leave", to "force away".  It does not have to literally mean "chasing" in a
physical sense, but can mean "to make something leave" through words. This is the
word used in the Supyire draft for this verse.
\tst Why did God chase them from the garden?  Because they did these bad things and ate
the fruit he told them not to eat
\ln 02.21a
\old {Why?}  Because they ate the fruits of the tree that God told them not to eat.

showed them not to eat. 
\old Then He said now they may be like me.  He knows the different between bad and good.
\old Then He said now you, man, may be like me.  He knows the difference between bad and
good. 
\cn BK explained that "they refused God's promise" can also be said that they betrayed God
or did not hold to the promise he had given them, which was to not eat of the fruit of the
one tree.  BK also explained "the relationship between them and God became hard" to
be that the relationship is broken.  It is what you would say when something happens
between people and they can no longer be together, help each other, work together... 
We know that the relationship between God and man was forever changed at this
moment, we see in in 3:22 that it is clear that he now knows the difference between

\tst What kinds of things did God promise them?  to eat all the trees in the garden but the
one, God was with them, walking and talking with them
\tst Tst2:   In retelling, he did tell of the hardness of their betweens / relationship between
them and God (line 21b), but he did not state line 21a, as to explain why God kicked
them out of the garden, even though this was an area that he talked about with us
during the questioning time.  This first sentence in line 21a may be omitted.  It is made
clear in the remainder of the sentence that they disobeyed God (refused His promise) by
eating the fruits of the tree God showed them not to eat. The fact that "they refused
God's promise" does not seem to be necessary and was omitted in retelling.
\tst Tst2 (retest):  This line was not retold in retesting and is implied throughout the story. 
Therefore, there is no need to explicitly state why God is kicking them from the garden
and this can be deleted.  Deleted.

\t Noah Story
\co Supyire
\p
\p
\co Redemptive Theme:  The story points to God saving those who have a good
relationship with Him.  The story shows that God uses His power for the provision of
those in good relationship with Him.
\co Basic Biblical concepts: God's all-powerful nature.  God's goodness is seen in His
hate for all things evil.    
\co Cohesion / Background:  The story connects the broken relationship with God and
sin entering the world, to now a world full of sin and evil.  Cohesively defines Noah
as a man in a good relationship with God.
\co Worldview / Selection Issues:  As many Supyire believe the only access to God is
through intermediaries or other spirit beings and do not believe a direct relationship
with God is possible, this story builds on what a relationship with God is, as Noah
hears from God and obeys.

\tst General Testing Comments from 8/15/08:  Tst Group 4 - Friend at Shop in Town:  Our
woman friend at the shop retold the entire story front to back.  She actually expanded
parts of the story.  For example,  she explained that God sent Adam and Awa out of the
garden because they had done something wrong against him and ate of the fruit of the
tree (remembering the previous stories). She expanded and included that God was
angry because there was sin everywhere and darkness everywhere on earth.   I was
impressed with the details that she remembered, everything from God closing the boat,
to God not forgetting them, to God blowing wind, to the number of days it rained, to the
figures of speech like the earth drinking the water, to a small detail like Nu and his
family praising God, to the idea that there will always be a rainy season and dry, cold
and heat, night and day.  See further details within BT lines.
\p
\tst General Testing Comments 8/22/05:  Tst5:  Day Guard.  The retelling of this story was
not as strong as Tst4.  There were some items that were summarized and some that
were skipped all-together.  See comments within BT text for further details of the
retelling.

\bt This is something true that has happened
\anc 2Ti.03:16 , Psa.119:142 (New Century Version) "...your teachings are true";
Psa.119:160 (NIV) "all your words are true"; Jhn.17:17 "your word is truth".
\ln 04.02
\bt There was a good {relationship} between Adama and Awa and God.

{KT: sin} to God.  
\old God sent Adama and Awa out of the {garden}.

\anc gen.03:06 , gen.03:22 -24 , 
\anc For relationship, see anchor comments at story 01:20b
\anc For relationship breaking, See anchor for story 2, line 21b.
\tst Tst4:  Why did God sent them out of the garden?  Their relationship with God was
closed.  The thing they did, eating the fruit of the tree they were told not to - that is why
God kicked them out.
\tst Tst5:  Why did God kick them from the garden?  They did a bad thing against God.  They
ate the fruit of the tree God told them not to and so He kicked them out.
\ln 04.03
\bt After a while Adama and Awa gave birth to some children
\anc gen.05:01
\ln 04.04
\bt Then these childen also gave birth to some children and this is the

\anc gen.05:02 ; gen.06:01
\ln 04.05
\bt When there were a lot of people, God realized [MM: {noticed}] that
there was nastiness everywhere.  God's face was soured.
\old When there were a lot of people, God realized that there was nastiness everywhere
\anc gen.06:05 , gen.06:06
\cn MM:  This expression "God's face was soured" is the literal translation meaning "to be
grieved, upset".  It is how the Supyire Draft translates "God was grieved in his heart".
\cn KH:  The Supyire word "pege" means corruption, wicknedness, violence, evil, or ill will. 
This is the term used in the Gen Supyire draft in both the Fall to describe the "nastiness"
placed between the snake and woman, Gen.03:15, & Noah, Gen.06:05, stories.  An
example of this would be "The evil which is in you against you God causes to come back
on yourself."  We have seen this when people talk about how people have come to harm
them or to do something through a fetish against a person or village.  We have seen
sacrifices left in public places specifically to bring an evil against another.  This word can
descrie this action especially if you are on the receiving end.
\tst Tst4:  How is nastiness everywhere?  It is like darkness.  It is everywhere.  Is it a good
thing?  The things they were doing were not good.
\tst Tst5:  What does it look like for nastiness to be everywhere?  People are not doing good
things, they were doing bad things.  Is there any nastiness here in Mali?  Yes.  An
example is sometimes people capture and kill other people for money.  That is evil. 
Sometimes husbands beat or kill their wives or wives kill their men.  How do people
know what are good things and what are bad things?  A person knows what a good thing
is to himself, what is good for himself can be good for another.
\tst Why is God's face sour?  He is angry.  The people are doing evil.  
\ln 04.06
\bt and he said, "I am going to destroy the world.

to create it.‚Äù
\anc gen.06:07 , gen.06:06
\tst Why did God want to destroy the world?  Because people were doing bad things.  
\tst This line was omitted in the retelling with Tst4, but retold in Tst5 which leads me to
believe the omission was simply performance error.
\ln 04.08
\bt But there was one man named Nu

\bt There was a good relationship between him and God.  
\anc gen.06:09 
\ln 04.09
\bt ...He was right in front of God and was respecting God and was
following God's {road}.
\anc gen.06:09
\cn MM:  The word for right, "t√¨√¨" has several meanings.  It can mean to go straight, in the
directional literal meaning.  ‚ÄúDo not turn right here, but go straight.‚Äù  It can also mean
‚Äúto be correct, right‚Äù.  As in, ‚ÄúWhat you are doing, is not right.‚Äù  We have heard this used
to describe people or their actions as being right or not right in the moral sense of the
word (as in English). When added to the end of another word, it can also mean simple,
not complex.  i.e. ‚Äúarajo-tiiwe‚Äù means ‚Äúa simple, non-complex radio.‚Äù  This is the word
used in the Supyire Gen. as NT draft to mean ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúrighteousness.‚Äù   Examples: It is
used in Gen. 6:9 to describe Noah‚Äôs relationship with God.  Also, in Gen 15:6 for
‚Äúrighteousness‚Äù, ‚ÄúAbram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.‚Äù 
It is found in the NT in Romans 10, for righteousness ‚ÄúSince they did not know the
righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not
submit to God's righteousness.  Christ is the end of the law so that there may be
righteousness for everyone who believes.‚Äù
\tst Why did God like Noah?  Because Noah did God's work.  He was "right" before God. 
Noah had confidence in God and his heart was good.
\tst Tst4:  How does Nu follow God's road?  He does God's work and is good for God.  Nu
listens to God's words.  People follow God's road by doing God's good things.
\tst This line was actually expanded in Tst4 retelling to state that Nu was "doing God's work";
however the line in its entirety was omitted in Tst5.
\tst Tst5:  Why did God choose Nu?  Nu was afraid of God.  Nu praised God and sought God. 
Why do you know this?  God killed everyone else on the earth, but saved him and
opened the world to him.
\ln 04.10
\bt Then God asked Nu to build a big canoe with many strong trees.  
\old Then God asked Nu to create a big canoe
\anc gen.06:14
\cn SS:  "The Supyire word for canoe is used for all boats.  If it is a small boat, you would
concretely add the Supyire word for "small" to the word for canoe/boat."  MM:  Our
backtranslator seemed to know the English word for "canoe" over "boat"... as we live in
a place far from water, boats are not common, but this Supyire word is well known
based on our testing.
\tst In Tst5, this line was retold as "There was a man named Nu and he told him to build a
boat with a big tree".  Based on retellings and potential confusion over where it is built
with one tree or many, (see comments here and line 12), this line was revised/combined
with line 12.
\ln 04.11
\bt Why?  Because I am going to destroy the entire world 
\anc gen.06:17

the boat.  This was retold in Tst4 and will not be deleted from the story.

\anc gen.06:14
\tst Tst4:  How do you think Nu built the boat?  He took many trees and made them like the
planks in the table.  He put a top on it.
\tst In the retelling within Tst5 this line was somewhat combined with line 10.  See tst
comments from that line.  Based on this, a simplification may occur to combine these to
state something along these lines, "God asked Nu to build a big boat with strong trees." 
In the testing within Tst5, the thought was that it was simply one big tree that the boat
was created with instead of many trees (see line 14).  The above change will hopefully
remedy this thought.
\cn This line has been deleted and combined with line 10 based on the above testing results.
\ln 04.13
\old As soon as you finish making it, rub the inner and outer of the canoe with the "liquid
plastic"
\old gen.06:14
\cn The liquid plastic is used as tar, example given was the tar in the road
\tst In testing, it was determined that the better word for "liquid plastic" or "tar" would be
"liquid road".  Yes, the term for "road" here is borrowed, but any choice of words here
for "tar" would be borrowed from somewhere.  An alternative is to delete this line
altogether.
\ln 04.14
\bt Then Nu built the canoe.
\old Then Nu did that work.
\anc gen.06:22
\cn MM:  This line was added back in final recording, our crafter repeatedly inserted this
phrase naturally.  It is unpacked and more natural than original wording.
\tst How did Noah know what to do?  Because God told him and he had faith in God.
\tst Tst4:  Why did Nu build the boat?  God told him to because He was going to destroy the
world.  God wanted Nu to build the boat to save him.
\tst Tst5:  How did Nu build the boat?  He was doing a good thing and was afraid of God.  He
cut a tree, a strong tree, and cut out the insides. The boat is very big because it had Nu,
his family, and the animals. So the tree was very big.  Was it one tree or many?  One
tree.

\tst I had questioned this particular line's significance in the story, however, it was retold in
both tst4 and tst5.
\tst Tst5:  How does God close a boat?  God can close it.  He closed the boat.  He made a
lid.  It was a big lid.  God did not want the rain to hit them, because it was a big rain and
killed everything else on the earth.

\bt And the water covered the earth for many days
\anc gen.07:24
\tst In Tst5 retelling, this line was omitted.  It may not need to be made explicit that the
water stayed on the earth.  Especially since it is implied through line 26 that it was the
breath of wind from God that caused the water to start going down. However, this line
will be retained based on the fact it was retold in previous sessions and it may cause a
gap in the story flow and questions as to why Noah was letting the bird out of the canoe.

\tst While in Tst4 retelling, this line was shortened to say "God didn't forget them",  it was

them, and only them, in the boat.  He doesn't forget them.
\ln 04.26
\bt And God blew the wind and the water started going down
\anc gen.08:01
\cn MM  We have used the same expression as in the Supyire draft.  It basically means that
God caused the wind to come.  Many times in Supyire, an action that occurs is
automatically credited to God.  For example, you say, "God sweeps the road."   It
doesn't mean that He literally "sweeps" the road, but it means that God causes the road
to be free from obstacles.  The same type of expression is used here.
\tst Tst4:  Why did God blow wind?  He blew the wind so the water would go back down into
the earth, so that you would see the ground again.
\tst Again, this line was said word for word in Tst4 retelling, however it was forgotten in Tst5
retelling.  However, it was discussed through the line of questioning.

\anc gen.08:09
\tst In Tst5 retelling, it was added to the story that the dove went out to "look", and then
came back.  This verb "to look" does make it more explicit as to why the dove is being
sent out; however, could potentially add a human-like characterstic to the bird making it
more closely linked to a Supyire folk story.  Do not feel this line should be changed.  It
was told as is in Tst4.

\tst In tst5, the fact the dove returned with a green leaf was omitted, and line 33 was not
stated until after line 34.  Based on tst4 retelling this portion correctly, this could
potentially be performance error.  Or it could be that the connection between the dove
bringing back the leaf and the knowledge that the water must be descending is not clear.

fearful of Him, and they wanted to do His work.  For example, people can pray for food
and for health and when He gives them food and health, they make Him big.
\tst Tst5:  Why did they praise God?  They were afraid of God - if they don't respect Him,
make Him big, they were afraid He might kill them.  (Note:  Here the word for "afraid" is
used similarly as the phrase "God-fearing" is in English, it includes a sense of awe and
respect for power.

be natural to cut this phrase, because it's only when the sky is dark, that a rainbow can
be seen to have appeared.
\cn MM:  The Supyire word for "rainbow" literally translates as "Rain's machete"  We have
had several discussions and quizzed several people on the word for "rainbow."  Is there
a traditional story for the rainbow?  No one seems to know or remember one.  Why is it
called Rain's Machete?  It's called that because it literally "cuts" the rain.  It is a sign that
the rain for that day is finished.  Another word for rainbow is the "rain rests".  Why
would God use this as a sign of His alliance?  God said he would not kill the earth again
by flood, so he stops the rain, the rain will rest or be cut, and there will not be a flood. 
God gave us this sign so that we would see it, remember Him and remember that He will
not forget His promise to not destroy the earth through flood again.  This is the term
used in the Supyire Genesis draft, Gen.09:13.
\ln 04.43

with you and your offspring
\anc gen.09:13 - 15
\tst Tst4:  Why is the rainbow there?  God put it there.  It tells us that the rain may fall, but
the earth will not be destroyed from it.
\tst Tst5:  Why does a rainbow come?  God bring it.  He told Noah he would lower it.  The
promise He made Noah - it will not be forgotten.
\tst While in Tst4 retelling the lines about the rainbow were included, and actually expanded
upon to say "now, when we see the rainbow, we know the rain has come, but it will not
destroy the earth"; in Tst5 the rainbow was omitted all-together in the final retelling.  In
the retelling that was not recorded, he did state these lines.

\anc gen.09:01
\tst Tst4:  How does God bless people?  God blessed Nu by telling him to have lots of
children.  God blessed them because they will fill the earth.  Today, God can bless us
with more children and more people to do work together.
\tst What does this story tell us about God?  We should be like Noah - right.  It also tells us
that people do sin, and sin is everywhere.  The story tells us that God is good.  The
world will not be destroyed like this again.
\tst What does the story tell us about God?  God is good.  The world will not be destroyed

many.  This line has now been simplified.

\t Abraham Story
\co Supyire
\p
\co Redemptive Theme:   The story begins to show how a good relationship with God
can be obtained through belief in Him.  The story shows God's desire for relationship
with man, even after sin has entered the world.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  God fulfills His promises (seen in intro of next story).  God's
power to provide.    
\co Cohesion / Background:  The story sets the stage for future reference to the
"Israelites" as "the people of the offspring of Abraham".  The story continues to
build the concept of relationship with God as He personaly guides and provides for
people.  It continues to call people to trust and obey Him.
\co Worldview / Selection Issues :  The story shows the benefits of good relationship
with God - His blessings and provisions.  Having descendants is a big desire within
the Supyire culture, therefore emphasis has been placed on God's promise and
power to provide the solution.

\tst Testing Results tst2:  Lady friend at Boutique:  This story has quite a bit more dialogue
than normal, that added some levels of difficulty.  But the story was retold well, one of
our testers retold story skipping the intro.  The intro was talked about within the
questions we asked was understood and explained.  The testing respondent retold the
Brehima story, without the intro other than saying that this is true... it was interesting
she retold the story without most of the dialogue but included what the dialogue meant. 
The fact that God did not forget the relationship he had with Adama & Awa and that God
chose a man to take care of this crowd on his behalf, in his name (which is literal
translation).  The parts about Brehima being told to leave, leaving, the blessings God
give him, and all that he takes with him.  One area that was skipped in the retelling was
Brehima's age, but they brought it up in disscussion on their own.  
\p
\tst Testing Results tst3: Day guard friend, this retelling was not as exact as the previous
retellings of this story, he skipped many of the details that are the meat of the promise
of this story.  Notes from his retelling are below.  While in this story and previous stories,
this testing group's retelling has been captured and has been the primary source for
questioning the story's retellability ...

\tst Tst4:  Woman friend in village:  Tested retellability.  Based on this most recent testings,
and previous testings, this story needs some revision to improve retellability.  This is
especially true of the dialogue in lines 7 - 11, and 18.  See individual lines for comments
on future revisions.
\p
\tst Retest:  After story underwent major revisions, story was retested and retold.  See
comments below as "Tst3(retest)".  Also retested with "Tst4" again.

\tst In tst3 the guard also retold this line well, but left out the detail that they filled the earth.
He said, "After Nu's time the members of his family gave birth to some children, they
became many."  Potentially, the expression "filling the earth" is not a good/normal
Supyire expression and it may be cut from the line and left as they became numerous.
\tst tst4:  This line was retold as, "Nu and his family's people were many and filled the
earth."  The expression for "filling the earth" can be retold; however, as it does not add
to the concept of his people becoming many, it will be cut from the line. Line Revised.

\anc gen.03:06 , gen.03:22 -23 , 
\anc For relationship, see anchor comments at story 01:20b
\cn MM:  It seems that our back-translator did not know the English term for relationship,
until just recently.  He had described this word in Supyrie every way he can but in asking
our crafter and multiple others we know, with confidence, the term in Supyire here can
translate to "relationship".  Our back-translator has described this word to be a
friendship but close to but not a promsie, this is a action to you or for you that you do
want, where there would be blessings and an alliance between people.
\tst Why did the blessings break down?  Because they broke it and took God's joy.
\tst How did they & God have a relationship?  they were together, they worked together, sat
together, they were a group just like we are now sitting and working together
\tst Why did God remember the relationship he had with Adama & Awa?  (The intro of the
story was retold.)  He remembers them even with the bad things they did, his mind went
back to them.
\tst In tst3 the guard did change this line to say, "But they took that relationship that they
had and it broke down." 
\tst Tst4:  This line was retold as.  "There was a relationship between God and Awa and
Adama, but they did a wrong thing, and the relationship between them was broken
(cut)."  She did change the Supyire wording of the relationship breaking. The wording
she used here naturally on her own was different from the original crafted version and
actually matches what the SIL translation team suggested we use for the relationship
between God and man breaking (the Supyire word used here literally translates "cut"). 
We will rephrase this sentence to match.  Revised to match as above.
\tst Tst3 (retest):  While this line has been retold, chronologically this line is out of place.  It
would be best to add this line, or make this the introductory transition in the Noah story
and remove it from this story.  (This and line 03b) Moved.

your family, let your father's village, and let your country, I will show you for them
where you are going "  Simply a different way of stating this line and does not warrant a

\cn TW TN's on Genesis says that "the text does not describe how God appeared or in what
form, only that it was the LORD who showed himself to Abram. He may have revealed
himself in a dream, vision or in some other manner." So we chose to go generic.
\tst How did God show himself to Brehima?  Well the story doesn't say, but maybe Brehima
had the eyes to see him
\tst How does God show himself now?  He hears us, he gives us children that are healthy and
can talk
\tst In tst3 this line was omitted from the retelling. See line 06.19.
\tst Tst4:  Again, this line was omitted.  Possibly not a bridge or comprehensible in Supyire
for God to "show himself" to someone.  Could be best stated as "God said to Brehima..." 
or as line 17 and 18 have been repetedly omitted from retellings, this indicated dialogue
is too heavy.  These lines could be summarized to state, "When they arrived at another
country, God told Abraham he would give this country to his offspring.  Then Brehima
praised God."  This would combine lines 16-19 and omit a section of dialogue that does
not seem to be retold well.  Revised to new line 11 above.

country's other people and God would guard them there.

\anc gen.12:07
\cn KH:  Scripture says that Abraham offered a sacrifice, but here (in Supyire culture), most
all sacrifices here are offered to fetishes here to gain power over something or to curse/
harm someone.  So in order to avoid possible misinterpretations of what Abraham is
doing or sacrificing to, it is generically stated that Abraham was worshiping God.
\tst Why did Brehima praise God?  Because he is going to have descendants, because he did
what God said & left his home and his family to do what God said.
\tst tst2:  Because God told him he would give that country to his descendants
\tst How did Brehima praise God?  How do you?  he thanked God and said it outloud, talking

\bt God said to Abraham, "Don't be afraid, I am going to take care of you,
I am going to do you a good thing."
\anc gen.15:01
\cn KH:  The literal translation of the phrase used here for "taking care"  is "to avoid the
birds"  It comes from literally keeping the birds off the fields, seeds... everything.  This
is also the same term used in the Supyire NT draft.
\cn KH: TN says, "The word should be translated ‚Äúreward.‚Äù ...Instead, he trusted God to
provide him what he needed. In response, the LORD said that he would greatly reward
Abram."  
\tst Why did God tell Brehima not to be afraid?  Because he is God and he wanted to talk
with Brehima.
\tst How is God going to take care of Brehima? (Retold this section of the story and past
this,) how the Lord would give him a descentant so his slave would not be the one to eat
his inhertitance.  He is like your night guard, you sleep and he watches your house and
walks around, he protects you.  He did it then because Brehima was scared.
\tst Tst3:  In the retelling, he  omitted the "I am going to do you a good thing" and replaced
it with "I will bless you."  It was kept as "good thing" in tst2.
\tst Tst4:  In the retelling, she omitted again the first part, but retold the "I am going to do a
good thing for him"  In her retest, this was retold.
\ln 06.14
\bt Then Abraham said, "What kind of good thing can you do to make me
happy?
\anc gen.15:02
\cn KH: "Happy" here literally means to "make your internal cold" 
\tst tst3:  What can God do to make a person happy?  God gave Brehima descendants from
his own family, he gave him his wife, his family.  Everybody wants a family, me?  A wife
and a family, this is a good thing to have.
\tst In tst3 the guard retold this well, "Brehima said, "What thing can you do that is good for
me?"

\cn KH:  In talking about an inheritance the literal way is described that your people after
you are going to eat what you leave them ---  whether it is fields to work or a storage
building full of a crop.
\tst tst3:  How can a slave eat a person's inheritance?  When you don't have any
descendants of your own, but God said no.  That he would have his own child to eat it
\tst tst3:  How can you have a slave born in your family?  When he works for you all the
time and he has to, but a worker is paid, slaves are born when they are there only to
always work.  Do people still have slaves today?  People have people who work for
them, there is always work to do.  Some are paid and some are not.
\tst In tst3 he said, "Brehima said, "The slave in my family is who will eat my inheritance." 
The line was retold well and does not need to be changed.  If any change is made, the
fact that the slave is "born" in my family could be omitted to simply state "the slave in
my family"  Revised.  See above.

same
\tst tst2: because now he doesn't have any children, only his slave, but he will have more
than the stars.
\tst In tst3 the guard said, "Look above count the stars, they are numerous, your offspring
will be numerous."  This is a good way to state this, possibly including "your offspring will
be numerous, like the stars."
\tst Tst4:  In retelling, she stated "are not the stars many, the descendants you will have will
be many."  Again, in both retellings they state it clearly that his offspring will be many.

\p
\tst General Testing 2 (Group of women + language helper in village):  Retold the story very
well.  The introductory transition was summarized very briefly in the retelling to state
that Breihma's offspring got big, and these words tell about how David became king. 
This could potentially be based on the fact that this group of women had not recently
heard the previous stories prior to this one.  See Tst4 for thoughts on this.
\p
\tst General Testing Comments:  Tst3:  Woman friend at boutique.  Unfortunately, she is one
who had not heard the previous stories.  Again, she skipped over the entire transition
into the story and started with "There was a man there.  He was God's messenger,
Samuel..."  This raises the question if a transition is really necessary, re-tellable, or if
this transition should be shortened.  See comments below.

\tst General Testing Comments:  Tst4: Day Guard Friend.  This testor had recently heard the
first 4 stories prior to this one.  He was able to tell the introduction, but does offer a

\tst Tst2:  How did God keep his promise with Abraham?  Gave him a big offspring.  Many

descendants and saw one who was tall and handsome with good skin and thought it was
him, but it was not.  God said no, that man looked at them but God looks at the heart.

field with the animals.  When he came God told Samuel - that is him.  He will be king.

nice-looking/handsome.  He has "polished skin that shines."  This is a good physical trait
to have.

heart, not how people look at people.

\tst Tst4:  This is retold as "When that moment passed, he came.   And God said, "This is the
king.  Pour oil on him and anoint him. He will be king one day."  Based on this retelling,
and retelling from Tst3 (see comment below), it may be best to add the phrase "He will

and see the new chief, greet him, bless him.  Drink. Eat a lot.  African dance.  Sacrifice
to fetishes.

good.  
\tst Tst2:  How do they do that in Mali?  They don't pour oil on people.  But they affirm them
with words like "You are capable."  "You can do this."  They acted out bowing in respect,
shaking hands in a respectful manner, and saying words of affirmation to the
up-and-coming "king" or chief.
\tst Tst2:  The only detail omitted in the retelling was the fact that pouring of oil on him was
done to show that he would be king one day.
\tst Tst3:  Again, the explicit unpacking of why they are pouring oil on his head has been
omitted in retelling.  This line simply told in the retlling as "He is going to be king one
day."
\tst Tst4:  This sentence was again omitted in retelling.  Therefore, it seems the unpacking of
the "pouring of oil on his head" is unnecessary information and distracts from the natural
story flow.  It will be deleted.  THIS LINE HAS BEEN DELETED.

He accepts you.  He was the first road, the road, he wants us to follow is God's road.
\tst Tst4:  In the retelling, He stated that God's Will (Part of God) descended into David's
heart.  We will further probe to see if there is a better way to restate this line.
\tst Tst:  Based on retellings, the concept of God's Spirit is not retold well.  The unpacking of
God's Spirit occurs later in the story set, in the birth set.  So, this line here, will be
changed to "Then God gave David power."  Revised.

\co Redemptive Theme:  This David series story continues to show an indepth study of
a man who has a personal relationship with God.  This story show's God's power
over enemies.  The story builds on the redemptive theme that those in good
relationship with God, those who trust in God's power for deliverance, are given
power from God and saved from their enemies.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  God is all-powerful.  
\co Cohesion / Background:  Continuing to build the recognition of "David"'s name for
the coming of the future King from his line of descendants
\co Worldview / Selection Issues :  Contniues to build on the direct "access" to God's

positively by BK and those who heard this in its inital round of testing.   In tst2, of a
group of several women in the village, the retelling went well.  One area that there
continually seems to be a bit of difficulty in the retell is the name of the "Philistines
people".  This is of course a foreign word, when the name was needed throughout the
story a couple of times they did say the "Philisti-people" and at other times they called
them "Goliath's people" .  We will look at future testing.

\co Redemptive Theme:   This David series story continues to show an indepth study of
a man who has a personal relationship with God.  This story again show's God's
saving power over enemies for those who trust in Him.  The story builds on the
redemptive theme that those in good relationship with God are ones who believe in
Him, that He will fulfill His promises.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  God fulfills promises - David becomes king.  God hears the
prayers of His people.  
\co Cohesion / Background:  The story introduces the concept of the coming King from
within David's descendants.  Continues to build the concept of what relationship
with God can be like - Man can communicate with God through prayer.
\co Worldview / Selection Issues :  This story shows God's power over enemies,
enemies who are not on God's road, but worshipping the fetishes.  The story again
shows God's promises to bless through the giving of a big offspring.

for David to be king, so they made him king.  He did kill Goliath.   Why did God make
David king? Because David took God's road, he feared God and did what God said.  God

good thing.  Yesterday, you said you would come and now you are here.  When with
elders, you do what they say.

\co Redemptive Theme:  The story points to the solution that by believing in God, there
can be a good relationship with Him.  God is more powerful than all things, nature
and fetishes.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  God is the one and only all-powerful God.  Call for obedience
and a view of disobedience and the worship of fetishes as sin.
\co Cohesion / Background:  The people of Abraham's offspring turn away from God,
again reiterating the need for restored relationship.  The story continues to build on
the concept of prayer and the fact that God's power is accessible through prayer.
\co Worldview / Selection Issues :  As it is typical in Supyire culture, to simply add
another belief or practice on top of traditional beliefs, this story was selected in part
to show that a choice must be made.  The story calls for recognizing God as God
alone, and only worshipping Him.  The story differentiates the worship of fetishes
and the worship of the True God.

modifying this line slightly to read, "After King David‚Äôs time, the people of Abraham‚Äôs
offspring let God‚Äôs road and took the road of the fetishes.‚Äù
\cn MM:  Based on the confusion in using the term "messenger" for both God's messengers
and Baal's messengers in retellings, this has been rephrased.  Eli is God's messenger. 
Baal's prophets are referred to as the "fetish worshippers".
\cn MM:  Culturally, these fetish worshippers are the ones responsible for the actual sacrifice
and worship give the fetish.  People come to these people to request things of the fetish. 
In a way, a fetish "chief".
\tst Tst2:  How do you turn your back on someone?  It's a bad thing to do.  I say I will come
greet you, but I don't.  I turn my back to you, and don't see you.
\tst Tst2:  How would you turn your back on God?  They did (past tense) pray to God and
work for him, but now (present) they did not.  They turned away, turned their backs on
God's road.
\tst Tst3:  Why did Abraham's offspring turn their back on God?  Because they believed in
the fetish.  The fetish, they thought, was good for them.  They turned their back on God
to follow Baal.
\tst Tst3:  Why would they praise Baal fetishes?  Because they thought Baal was good for
them since they had turned their backs on God.  When something is good for you, you
say it and give it praises.
\ln 20.03
\bt One day, God {sent} his {messenger} Eli to the {king} of Abraham's
offspring and said,

\anc 1ki.18:19
\cn KH:  Numbers seem to be a difficult area for us.  Most all of the time when numbers are
used they are spoken in the trade language, Bambara, therefore using the proper
Supyire is difficult for many to understand.  In testing, the number has been
misunderstood and therefore removed from the story.
\tst Tst2:  Why do you think Baal fetish have many messengers?  Because they had one, but
then the other's came to follow, listen, do what he said.
\ln 20.14
\bt When they arrived there, 
\old They went to the mountain.
\old In the morning, they went to the mountain.
\anc 1ki.18:20
\tst Tst3:  Why would they meet on a mountain?  So they would know who the true God is. 
(Testor retold this part of story).  They could see who the true God is because they
danced for Baal - they were going to kill 2 bulls and pray to Baal and God to see who the
true God is.
\ln 20.15
\bt Eli came near to the people and said, "When are you going to worship
{KT: praise} God?"
\old Eli [kh: came near to them and] said to everbody, "When are you going to dance not for
Baal but for the Almighty [kh: the Lord] God?
\anc 1ki.18:21
\cn KH:  In cultural observation, dancing can be a part of worship or a way to give praise to
something or someone. 
\tst Tst2:  Why would you dance for a person or for God?  Eli came to have them worship
God.  Why?  Because it is good for them - to show how good it is for them.  So they
should dance for God.
\tst Tst3:  Why are the people dancing for Baal?  (Testor retold part of story).  Because they
killed a bull for him to answer, they prayed and prayed and prayed but he didn't
answer.  They were praying and dancing for him to answer.
\ln 20.16
\bt You cannot worship the fetish and worship {KT praise} God together. 
You must choose one.  If you think God is the true one, praise Him.  If
you think the fetishes are the true ones, worship them.
\old If our Father [KH: Lord] is the true God worship [MM: {praise}] him, if Baal is the true
god worship [MM: {praise}] him."
\anc 1ki.18:21
\cn BK:  This is stating you cannot worship both the fetish and God.  You cannot worship
them both at the same time.  
\cn MM:  Culturally, the act of simply worshipping multiple things or practicing the customs of
many religions is very common here.  They synchronize and simply add one to another,
keeping the aspects of their old ways.  This thought of having to choose one and not
worshipping both, should draw the attention of the Supyire.
\ln 20.17
\tst In testing, it was explained to us that Eli is giving the people a choice.  They must divide
ways.  They must choose to either "give confidence to" or "follow" God or Baal.
\tst What did Eli say to the people on the mountian?  either worship God or worship Baal and
bring 2 bulls  
\bt But no one answered Eli.

\cn MM:  Line revised in Final Recording for simplicity.  
\ln 20.20
\bt Each one is going to kill his bull to his God
\anc 1ki.18:23
\cn KH:  Animal sacrifice is commonly practiced here to fetishes.  A bull would be a culturally
big item for sacrifice, emphasizing the importance of this event.
\tst Tst2:  How would killing a bull show who God is?  Because when they kill a bull, God will
answer, he will answer.  
\ln 20.21
\bt Each one will {pray} to his god.  The one who is the true God, he will
let fire down on the {sacrifice}, and burn it."
\old The one whose prayers {KT: pray} may make fire has the true God.
\anc 1ki.18:24
\tst Tst3:  How can they know who the true God is?  They had a sacrifice for God to answer
with.  Eli knew God is the true God.
\tst Tst3:  What kinds of things do people do here?  The Christians pray to the true God
here.  The Muslims pray, but not to the True God, the ones who follow the fetish - they
don't know the true God, they don't know what they do.
\tst Tst3:  How can prayers make fire?  Baal's people gathered sticks, killed their bull, and
prayed prayed prayed, but he didn't answer.  They wanted him to answer with fire, but
he didn't.  Eli then mocked them.  Why didn't Baal answer?  He is not the true God.
\tst Tst3:  In the retelling, lines 20 and 21 were omitted.  Lines 22 was restated, "... Eli told
them to do their sacrifice first because they are numerous."  Based on the foreign
concept of "prayers making fire", it may be best to restate "the God who answers by
causing a fire to burn the sacrifice, is the true God."
\ln 20.22
\bt Then he said, the fetish worshippers, who are numerous, have to start
first to burn their bull.

\old They may kill their bull and look for wood and arrange it.
\anc 1ki.18:26
\tst Tst3:  Why would they kill bulls to their gods?  Because Eli said to Abraham's offspring to
take one and he took the other one.  They killed the bulls to see who the true God is.
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, this line was rephrased, "They gathered wood and put the sacrifice on
it."  This is a good rephrasing of the end of this sentence.  "They killed their bull.  They
gathered the wood and arranged it and put the sacrifice on it."
\ln 20.24
\bt Then they prayed to the fetish, but he didn't answer.  
\old Then they prayed to Baal but he didn't answer and there was no sign.

\tst Tst2:  Why did Baal not answer?  They said he could answer, but they cannot make him
God.  He is not God.  
\tst Tst3:  Why did Baal not answer?  Baal is not the true God.

\bt Until the sun is on the top of their heads,
\anc 1ki.18:27
\cn KH:  It is common to express "noon" as "when the sun is on top of our heads". Time is
often expressed in terms of where the sun is located along its course.

\bt Then Eli said, "Ask him again, he may be sleeping or he may be away. 
He may be around doing something more important than that."
\anc 1ki.18:27

knew Baal was not the true God.  
\ln 20.27
\bt And they were crying out and jumping, but they had no answer.
\anc 1ki.18:29 
\cn KH:  At many of the animistic ceremonies we have attended, funerals and burials in
particular, it seems that the act of "crying out", "shouting", and even "jumping around or
dancing", is done.  This appears to be done to call on the power of their fetishes.
\tst Tst2:  Why would the people want a sign?  What does a sign look like?  They wanted to
know (to know that he is God), but the sign did not come.  A sign is like when you dream
that you are hungry and you want food, then when you wake it comes.
\tst Tst2:  Why were Baal's messengers crying and jumping?  So that their god would hear
them and answer what they are praying.

\anc 1ki.18:34
\tst Tst2:  Why would Eli pour water on the bull?  So they would believe in God's road. 
Why?  Because they said their god could, but Eli was showing them how his God would.
\tst Tst3:  Why did Eli put water on the bull 3x?  He wanted it wet, so the sacrifice would

is there; however, for retelling purposes, the "hole around the place" in line 30, and this
line could be deleted from the story.

they know God.
\tst Tst3:  How did God let the fire down?  It was God's fire.  He let it down because Eli

\cn BK:  The act of lowering heads and putting the forehead on the ground can show either a
personal shame or a respect of those who are before you.  Here it is as a form of
worship.

and everything was wet.  But God answered Eli's prayers and burnt it all up.
\tst Tst3:  How did the people know God is the true God?  They knew Eli's God was true
because Eli did a sacrifice, and so did the others to Baal.  But Baal did not take theirs.

\t Isaiah Prophecy
\co Supyire
\p  
\co Redemptive Theme:  The story builds on the problem of sin in terms of people
leaving God's road.  The story connects that all people have done wrong.  The story
points to the solution in terms of the coming one who will restore relationship
between man and God.  The story points to God's power over sin and over death by
rising this coming one from death.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  All have sinned.  There is one who will come, suffer, and die
for our sins.   
\co Cohesion / Background:  People "turning their backs" and "leaving God's road". 
God's desire for people to have relationship with Him, to be "on His road". 
Cohesively speaks of the coming king within Abraham's offspring who will reign
forever.  Introduces the concept that the coming one will "suffer and die" for man's
sin.  Introduces this "Savior" that the people are now waiting for.

are strong - they can kill people, but not all of the people or all the time.  The fetishes
don't help people though.  So the people who don't know God's Words do this because
they don't know. But the fetishes can't hurt people who have God's Words.  We do what
God's words say, the whole world when they don't have God's Words, do bad things.

\tst Tst2:  How will he take the load of our sins?  We do bad things, but he will take them
from us.  God will put them on top of him.  God said he is our Savior.  He will take our
bad things away from us - Our Savior will take our bad things and take them beside God
- So when God judges us, He does not see those bad things.

and save us by His work.

from their sins.  Also liked how when Mariam was told she's having a baby, she said,
"How?" and God made it happen.

\t John the Baptist and the Baptism of Jesus
\co Senufo Supyire
\p
\co Redemptive Theme:  This story points to the solution that the Savior who is coming
has the power over evil, power to save the good.  The story therefore points to the
need to have good relationship with God and be saved from the coming judgment.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  The story introduces concepts such as baptism,
repentence, judgment, forgiveness.  Jesus is God's Son.
\co Cohesion / Background:  The story introduces the concept that some leaders of
God's praying house are not truly following God's road.  The story introduces the
concept of "repentence" in terms of "leaving your old road" and "taking God's road"
and calls people to be baptized in order to show this repentence.

\anc KH:  Within the French Bible Parole De Vie "change your way of living" is used for
repent.  
\tst How do people change your way of living?  to follow God's road and to not do bad things
\tst Tst2:  How does baptism show you have changed your ways?  When you go into the
water and come out.  You are one.  It says you don't want to do your bad things
anymore.  You want to do the good.  John said (retold story) now that you have let your
bad things, you should give our shirt and food to the ones who don't have any.
\tst Tst2:  Why will God forgive sins?  Because it says you want to be like God now and leave
your bad things behind you.  
\tst In tst2 he retold this line as, " Then the Lord will forgive you, for how you have turned
your back to him."  
\tst Tst3:  In the retelling, she omits this as well.  Possible rephrasing of this "changing your
way of living" could be to "It shows you have left other roads and taken God's road."  As
it seems in testing, "taking God's road" keeps appearing in the responses.  (However, for
now, as this is the way it is stated in the Supyire NT draft, and is used in future stories, it
will be left as is).
\tst Tst2 (Retest):  Line omitted in retelling.  Will change phrasing of keyterm repentance to,
"It shows you have left your old road, and taken God's road."  Revised.

\old This is what he said in the [kh: in God's] {messenger} Isaiah's book, 'I said that it is

\anc luk.03:04 Note: verse 4 NIV says, "As written in the book of the words of Isaiah the
prophet: "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make
straight paths for him."
\tst Why does he say to make the road straight?  When God finishes sins, the road you take
becomes straight.
\tst Tst2: How can you make the road straight?  By taking only God's road, no other roads -
not the fetish road, but God's road.  That means praying to Him and not going to any
others.
\tst In tst2 and tst3 this line was omitted from the retelling, as it has been in previous

\tst How and why is one baptized?  to show people that you want to follow God's road, to go

\tst Tst2:  Why would the people from God's praying house come to be baptized?  Because
they want to be baptized.  They were not on God's road before.
\tst Tst2 (retest):  Why are the people from God's Praying House coming to be baptized? 
Because when you are baptized, put in and taken out of water, it shows that you want to
turn from your bad things and walk correctly on God's Road.  You would give a shirt to a
person who doesn't have any.  You would give food to a person who doesn't have any. 
So the people of God's Praying House have come because they want people to think
they are on God's Road.  Because, if they were not there, the people would think bad of
the people from God's Praying House.

follow God
\tst Why does he call the people snakes?  Because they weren‚Äôt following God‚Äôs road ‚Äì were

\tst Tst2:  Why did John ask, "Who told you...?"  Because they had come to be baptized and
John believed they had broken God's road - that they had done bad.
\tst Tst2:  He elaborated to say, "These snakes are like the snakes who crawl in the grass
and bite at your heels.  John said this because they were doing bad things but they had
one to get rid off and turn away from their bad things - to be forgiven.
\tst In tst2 this line was retold with the exception of "Who showed you God's road?" 
\tst Tst3:  Who is John calling snakes?  The people from God's Praying House.  
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, this line was omitted.  Based on confusion and blurring of the meaning
of this line and why John is calling them "vipers" and who he is calling "vipers", I propose
changing this line to read, "John said, 'If you only came to be baptized so other people
will think you have changed your ways, but you have not changed your ways; you
cannot escape God punishing you."  (ref. TN).  We will change the line.  If in future
retellings, it is still not retold, it will be deleted.
\tst Tst2 (retest):  Why are they called vipers?  Because they are not right.  They are not
walking on God's road.  They are not giving their clothes or food to those who don't have
it.  They came to be baptized so people will think they have turned away from their
wrongdoings, but they have not turned away.  They are called snakes because these
snakes are really bad, the people from God's Praying House are bad, their hearts are
bad and broken.
\tst Tst2 (Retest): In retelling, he retold this line.  Revision is okay, however will be changed
to cohesively match idea of repentence expressed in terms of "road".   Revised.

blurring between the leaders of God's Praying house and the general public that had
gathered.

them that just being baptized would not forgive them of their bad things.

to give and share with those who do not have something is easily understood and
practiced.
\tst Tst2:  Why would you give your shirts or food away?  Because there is one who doesn't
have any - no shirts or food.  He might die without this.

\tst Why do people think he is God's Chosen One?  Because of God's Words that he speaks. 
\tst Tst2:  How do you think inside your heart?  We now - I am thinking about these, God's
Words.  They were thinking about John's words, wanting him to be Jesus, but he is not.
\tst Tst2:  Why do they think he is the Chosen One?  Because of all the words John was
saying.  So they came to see.   
\tst In tst2 this line was retold as, "They were thinking he is God's Savior that they were
waiting for to come."  We will be removing "inside of their hearts" from the story.  Based
on cohesive themes of the savior to come in previous stories, can this be changed to the
"Savior" here and omit "God's Chosen One" from story set as it seems difficult to retell. 
"God's Chosen One" is currently in two future stories, "Woman at Well and Death" and
could also then be removed from the "Birth" story.  Revised and Retold in Retest.

\anc luk.03:16
\tst Tst2:  Why does John baptize with water?  Because that is what you do.  You go in and
out of water.  John baptized with water - water can wash away the dirty.
\tst Tst2:  How did John know what they were thinking?  Because they wanted John to be the
one who is to save them, but John knew there was one coming after him who would
baptize with fire and be stronger than him.
\tst In tst2 he said, "Then John said, there is one coming after me, I baptize with only
water."  The omission of "He is more powerful than me" could be performance error.  It
will remain in the story.
\tst Tst2 (retest) :  In retelling, he states this line and does not need changing.  He does
chronologically place the phrase "I am only baptizing you in the water below, in line 11. 
See comments there.
\ln 28.11

\old I am not even allowed to untie his shoes.  He is the one who is going to baptize people

\anc luk.03:16
\cn BK:  Word for word, the phrase "My head is small next to his" is comparing two heads,
but the meaning is "he is powerless in front of him or compared to him, he is low".
\tst Why can't John untie his shoes?  Jesus is too high.  It's like we are too inferior to until
the shoes of ATT. (president of Mali)  There is a big gap between the two.
\tst Why can't John untie his shoes?  because He is more powerful then John.  Example:  I
cannot untie the shoes of the Mali president.
\tst Why does he say Jesus will baptize with God‚Äôs Spirit and fire?  Those who follow will go
and be with God, those who don‚Äôt will be burned in fire.  It‚Äôs like the grain example‚Ä¶. He
will separate the good grain from the bad and burn the bad.
\tst Tst2:  How can a person baptize with God's Soul and fire?  Because these are what God's
Words said Jesus would do.  He would do it.  God knows - to be baptized with fire would
burn you, but if Jesus is to do it, it is a good thing.
\tst In tst2 our day guard said, " But there  is one coming after me who will save you, he will
baptize with fire and God's Spirit, I cannot untie his sandals."  He changed the order of
the things in this line, but all the desired meaning was communicated, with the addition
of "who will come to save you" which does not warrent a change in the line but offers a
connection of who the people thought John was, with who Jesus really is.  Could add this
phrase, "He is the one you are waiting for."  or "He is the savior you are waiting for." 
The concept of "untying sandals" can be unpacked as explained by our craftor to literally
state, "My head is low, next to his.", which expresses an unworthiness of John compared
to Jesus.  This will be added here.  Revised.
\tst Tst2 (retest):  in retelling, he states thie line, as well as the new phrase "My head is low
next to his."  However, he includes the phrase "I baptize you in water only, but He is the
one who is going to baptize people with ...."  This actually sounds more natural than as
is.  It will be moved.    Moved.

\tst Why does it say he will burn the useless part of the grain?  They are bad people.  They

\t Woman at the Well
\co Supyire
\p
\co Redemptive Theme:  This story begins to cohesively express the concept of
redemption through the theme of relationship - as the people here "trust" Jesus. 
This same word for "trust" is seen in previous stories, as in Abraham, to bring a
good relationship with God.  The solution to sin, Jesus, is made clear as He himself
states He is the Savior they are waiting for.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  Through Jesus, one can have eternal life.  Jesus has God's
all-knowing power.     
\co Cohesion / Background:    The story introduces the selection of Jesus' disciples and
begins His ministry time.  The story shows Jesus' desire for relationship with people,
even a woman he's not supposed to relate with.
\co Worldview / Selection Issues :  Water is a very important aspect of life here.  The
Supyire people live in a dry place, where water is sometimes not available.  This
story was selected to emphasis God's provision in terms of "water" - water that
Jesus offers of eternal life.   Also, as knowledge is power here - Jesus' power will be
seen in the story.

\tst General comments regarding original test sessions:  (Tested twice in our original village
- once with group of men and women during onsite consultation.  Tested again with
group of younger women).  They seem to relate well to this story - the concept of water
and thirsting for water is huge here.  Also, the concept of worshipping false idols on a
mountaintop is something that happens here.  They do seem to like the fact that Jesus
knows everything about this woman, confirming the fact that knowledge here is power. 
They retold the story well as a group, only omitting a part of the dialogue between Jesus
and the woman - about the mountaintop and "you don' t know who you are
worshipping...".  We will further test to determine if the story is too long and the dialogue
needs to be shortened or not.
\p
\tst General Comments - Tst3 - Story told in "storying/discipleship group" of women/men in
village:  After listening to the story 3 times, they retold the story in amazing detail.  The
only line omitted was line 06 about the woman questioning the fact that Jesus didn't have
anything to draw the water with.  They also stopped short of saying the very last
sentence, "He is the World's Savior."  However, they themselves brought this last
sentence up in later questions.

\old And the woman said, "If you knew the people you are talking to, you should not ask me

\anc Jhn.04:09
\cn MM:  The order of phrasing in this line was switched based on final recording and his
natural tendency to place the phrases in this order.  He did this on his own for both
retellings.
\cn BK:  The Supyire word used here for "no relationship" implies that there is no link
between the villages and that there are misunderstandings there.
\tst Why did the woman say Jesus should not ask her for water?  Jesus' village and the
woman's village have no dealings with each other.  Things like this happen here in Mali.
\tst Tst3:  What was the woman thinking when she asked "Why are you asking me for some
water?"  She knew that her people and Jesus' people had no relationship.  He should not
be talking to her and asking her for water.
\tst Tst3:  Do you think Jesus knew that his people and her people had no relationship? 
Hesitation.  First said no.  Then realized, "yes."  It was then discussed how they liked this
part because it shows that Jesus likes the woman because he speaks to her and offers
her water that gives life forever.
\tst Tst4:  What was the woman thinking when she asked "Why are you asking me for
water"?  Because her people and Jesus' people were not the same.
\tst Tst4:  How did she know there was no relationship between their people?  Because she
had learned about it.  
\ln 30.05
\bt So Jesus said, "If you knew the person you are talking to, you would
ask me for some water to drink.  I would give you some water, water
that will give life {forever}."
\cn The word for living water here is literally translated, "water that gives life that has no
end".
\anc Jhn.04:10
\tst Tst3:  What is Jesus' water?  It is water that gives life forever.  It is like a spring, that
never stops.  
\tst Tst3:  How do people get Jesus' water?  You follow God's road.  You believe and trust
Jesus.  
\tst Tst4:  Why should she ask Jesus for water?  Because Jesus is the Savior, but she didn't
know that.  
\tst Tst4:  How does Jesus give water that gives life forever?  Because you will be entered on
God's Road.  
\tst Tst4:  In retelling, he omits the last sentence.  "I would give you some water, water that
will give life forever. 
\tst Tst5:  In her retelling, she includes this last sentence and it does not need to be
changed.  
\ln 30.06
\bt Then the woman said, "This well is too deep.  But you have no [MM:
bag] to pull the water from the well with.  Where will you find that
water?"
\anc Jhn.04:11
\tst Tst4:  How does the woman think Jesus will get this water?  She thinks he will pull water
from the deep well and give it to her.  Where does he get his water?  From God's Words
that he will tell the woman.
\tst Tst4:  In retelling, he phrases this last question as , "How will you give me this water?". 
However, in tst5, she kept the phrasing the same, "Where will you find the water that
you are going to give me?"  This phrase does not need changing.
\ln 30.07
\bt Then Jesus answered her, "If someone drinks water from that well, he
will get thirsty again.  But the water I'm giving, if someone drinks that
water, he will not get thirsty again.
\anc Jhn.04:13 -14
\tst Tst4:  How can Jesus' water make you not thirst again?  Now, here, you drink, but then
you walk to your house and have to drink again.  But Jesus' water is God's Words. 
Words that are true.
\ln 30.08
\bt The water will be [MM: inside him] like a spring, that gives life
forever."
\anc Jhn.04:14
\tst What do you think is Jesus' water?  It is peace, food, strength, power, blessings.  Why is
it like a spring?  Jesus' water will never finish in your stomach.  It is like water that
comes up into a well.  Springs are a good thing.
\tst Tst4:  How can it be inside him?  Because Jesus said so.  God's Words are big and they
will not stop.  
\tst Tst4:  How is it like a spring?  Because it will not stop.  It is like the rivers - the water
goes and does not stop. 
\tst Tst4:  Again, he omits the phrase "that gives life forever."  However, this is included in
Tst5 retelling and does not need to be changed.

\anc Jhn.04:17 - 18
\tst How do people here view women like this?  This is possible and happens here.  People
do not like these women, because their hearts are not good.
\tst How does Jesus know this about the woman?  God gives him intelligence and wisdom.
\tst Tst4:  How did Jesus know all of this about the woman?  Because God told him
everything.
\ln 30.12

words in your mouth."
\old And the woman said, "Ah... you say the truth.  I know that you are one of God's
messengers {KT: messenger}..."
\anc Jhn.04:19
\tst Why does the woman say this?  She knew he was God's messenger because of His
words... of what he knew.
\tst Tst4:  Why did the woman think Jesus is one of God's messengers?  Because he knew
things about her.  God's messengers knew lots of things.
\tst Tst4:  This line was omitted from retelling.  Lines 12 - 15 should be simplified and/or
unpacked for ease of retelling.  "Ah... you say the truth.  God has surely given you these
words.  I want to ask you, 'Why have our ancestors worshipped on the mountain, but
your people, the people of Abraham's offspring, say we should worship God somewhere
else.?"   Revised.

\bt "I‚Äôm going to ask you why our grandfathers were praising {KT: praise}
on that mountain, and you, the people of Abraham's offspring, are

\anc Jhn.04:20
\cn BK: "Even now in the village, there are some mountains people have their personal gods
they are worshipping.  They wonder if they have a problem, they want to see a god.  In
general, those types of gods are situated on mountains.
\tst What do people here do on the mountains?  People pray to their idols on mountains. 
Many Malians worship idols on mountains.
\tst Tst4:  Why did the woman ask why Abraham's descendants praised God somewhere
else?  Because she knew that Abraham's descendants people were praying to God - the
others were on top of the mountain doing fetishes and not praying to God but to
something else.  Abraham's descendants people prayed to God.
\tst Tst4:  In retelling, he uses the word "pray" and "praying to God" instead of "Praise." 
Performance error is most likely as he has retold the word "praise" many times in
previous story retellings.
\ln 30.14
\bt And Jesus said, "A day is coming, when it will not be important that
we praise God in another place."
\old And Jesus said, "A day is coming, you are not going to praise God on that mountain or
even somewhere else.
\anc Jhn.04:21
\cn BK:  This means, "that place to worship God has no importance, only your heart."
\tst Why does Jesus say this?  Because one day, you will pray to God not on the mountain. 
They will know God and follow God's road.  If they understand Jesus' words, they will not
go and pray on the mountain.  Even today, before people know Jesus, they go and pray
to idols on the mountains, because they don't know Jesus.
\tst Tst4:  Why will they not praise God on the mountain or somewhere else?  Because they
will all know God one day and not the others.
\tst Based on retellings, proposed line revision:  "A day is coming, when it will not be
important where you praise God.  God wants us to praise Him with our heart (or
insides)."  Revised.
\ln 30.15
\bt "God wants us to praise Him with our hearts. "
\old You don't know the one who you are praising, but we know the one we are praising. 
Those who are praising God with truth and soul {KT: spirit} are the one that God loves
{KT: love}."
\anc Jhn:04:22 - 23
\cn MM:  Who is someone who praises God with truth and soul?  BK: It is someone who
really agrees with the reason that he‚Äôs practicing‚Ä¶ is convinced.  Even some Muslims go
to the mosque to avoid people saying, ‚ÄúAh, he has no religion.‚Äù  He is praying in front of
people for people, not for God. ‚Ä¶ everything is near the heart.
\tst How do people worship with truth and soul?  These people really trust and believe God. 
By believing and trusting Jesus, he enters you and gives you the ability to worship in
truth.  Is it possible to "praise God" without truth and soul?  Yes, it's possible here. 
Example - people going to church or to mosque not because they want to, but because
their parents do.
\tst Tst4:  Why does God love them?  When your spirit comes to praise God and you say and
do these things, God loves you.  
\tst Tst4:  The meaning of this line was not captured in the retelling.  See simplification
proposed above in Line 14.  Revised.

\bt And the woman said, "We know, the Savior we are waiting for {KT:
Christ} will come.  He will tell us all the facts.
\old And the woman said, "We know, the {Savior} will come.  He will tell us all the facts.
\old And the woman said, "Really, we know that God's {Chosen} will come.  When he comes,
he will tell us all the facts"
\anc Jhn.04:25 , Supyire NT draft uses, "God's Chosen One" here.  "We know that the
Messiah will come (They call him "God's Chosen One.")
\anc GeCL has "the promised Saviour," both here and in most other places. (In Matt 2.4 it has
"the promised King," but see Matt 2.2 for the reason for the shift.) Either "the promised
King," "the promised Saviour," or even "the promised Saviour King" expresses
accurately the meaning that the original readers would have received.
\tst What do you think when you hear "God's Chosen One"?  Jesus.  God's Commissioned
One.  God choosing and sending a "Good One" - Jesus is God's correct person.
\tst Tst4:  How did she know God's Chosen One will tell the facts?  Because she knew he
would come and tell the facts.  Like now, Jesus has come and told her all about her. 
Jesus is there telling the facts.
\tst Tst4:  In the retelling, he again did not say "God's Chosen One", but on his own , said
"Savior."  This is a key term that will be used throughout for "Christ, Messiah, God's
Chosen One.".  Also in the retelling, he states, "When he comes, we will pray to God." 
He keeps the cohesive nature of what is happening in lines 14-15 - praying to God. 
However, these lines will be reworked.  Revised.

man.  He looks like God's Chosen One.  {Why}? Because He knows all about me."
\anc Jhn.04:28 - 29
\tst Why does the woman say He "looks like" God's Chosen one?  Because of the words that
Jesus told her and what he knew about her.
\tst Tst4:  Why did she go and tell the village?  She went to tell them so they could believe in
Jesus and he come and save them.
\tst Tst4:  In retelling, again, he substitutes "Savior" here.  He also omits the last phrase,
"Why? Because he knows all about me."  However, this was retold in Tst5.
\ln 30.18b
\bt So the people left and came to Jesus.
\old So now the people came to Jesus to hear from his own mouth.  And many trust Jesus.
\anc Jhn.04:30 , Jhn.04:39
\tst Tst4:  Why did they come to hear from Jesus?  Because to know God's Chosen One.  It
is good for them to come and listen.  They wanted to know who God's Chosen One was.
\tst Tst4:  Why did many trust in him?  They trusted in Jesus because they trusted in God's
Chosen One.  
\tst Tst4:  The phrase, "to hear from his own mouth... And many trust Jesus" was not
included in retelling.  This can be deleted.  The phrase "to hear from his own mouth" is
not necessary and "And many trust Jesus" is repeated below. Revised.
\ln 30.19
\bt Then they asked Jesus to say in the village a few days.  So Jesus
stayed there and taught them God's Words.
\old Then they asked Jesus to spend a few days.  So, Jesus was teaching them and many
trust him.
\anc Jhn.04:40 - 41
\tst Tst4:  In retelling, this was somewhat rearranged to state, "They asked him to stay in
the village a few days to teach them.  So He stayed there several days.  Then they said
they trusted him."   This line could be rephrased to make a more natural flow, "They
asked Jesus to stay in the village a few days.  So, Jesus stayed there a few days and
taught them. Then, many trusted him because of his words.  Revised.
\ln 30.20
\bt Then many people trusted {KT trust} Jesus because of his words.  And
the people said, "Truly, this is the world's {Savior}."
\old Then they said to the woman, "We didn't trust him because of your words, but we hear
from his own mouth."  And said that, "We know he is the world's {Savior}."
\anc Jhn.04:42
\tst Why do many people trust Jesus?  They don't just trust her words, but they trust Jesus
because they have been with him and heard His words.
\tst How and when do you trust people here in Mali?  Here, there are many people that are
not correct, that you cannot trust.  But, if I commission someone (assign them with
something to do for me), then I must know them really well and believe them.
\tst Why do they say Jesus is the world's savior?  Because Jesus' road is life's good road. 
The road you should take.  A savior is someone who saves, literally "buys" the world. 
Jesus saves the world by forgiving the world - you believe in Jesus and he forgives.
\tst Tst4:  How do they know he is the world's savior?  Because the woman believed in
Jesus, but they wanted to know too.  When Jesus stayed with them and taught them,
they knew from God's Words that he was the one God sent to save the world.
\tst Tst4:  In retelling, it was stated as, "They did not trust him because of the words the
woman has said.  Because the words he said to them, they trust him. They trusted him
and said, ‚Äúhe is the world‚Äôs savior.‚Äù"
\tst Tst5:  In retelling, she point blank said, "They did not trust the words of the woman. So
they and Jesus spoke together.... Then they said, "Yes.  You are this one."  They trusted
in Jesus now.  Because of Jesus' words, they knew the woman was speaking truth.  .... 
"  Based on these retellings, this line could be simplified.  There is no need to draw out
an implied distrust between the woman and the village people.  This line can be
simplified to, "Many trusted him because of his words (end of proposed line 19 above)
and said, "He is the world's Savior."  Revised.
\p
\tst What part of the story do you like?  Jesus' water is good water - like a spring, with no
end, that gives life forever.  Also, how Jesus knew everything about the woman.  Also,
that the people wanted to see Jesus and after they saw him and heard him speak, they
trusted him.

\ln Further Thoughts from Tst3, Storying Group:
\tst What did you like about the story?  I liked that Jesus gives water that gives life forever. 
That you don't have to be thirsty anymore.  I like that Jesus was travelling around to
other villages and came to this one.  I like when the people believe Jesus because of His
own words.  I like when Jesus says "I am God's Chosen One."  I like that there is a day
coming when people won't worship on mountaintops,.
\tst What part did you not like?  I didn't like how the woman did not have this water that
Jesus was offering.  I didn't like how the woman's water would leave her still thirsty.  I
didn't like that the woman didn't offer Jesus water - you offer strangers water, you give
them something to drink.
\tst What does the story tell you about God?  The He is good.  That you should take His road
and do His work.

\old One day the workers of the owner of the farm, went to visit the farm.  They found that
these weeds were growing up between the growth.  They returned home and said to the
owner, "Chief, didn't you sow a good grain in the farm?"
\anc mat.13:27
\cn MM:  The word here used for "visit" also implies "to check" or "to guard".  Even on a day
in which people are not "working" the fields, they send someone out to the fields to look
and check them and ward off any animals that may be disturbing them.  The word here
used for "growth" is the same as nurture or seed.  It is understood in testing to be the
good seed that was planted and is now growing up.
\tst Tst3:  Why would the workers ask if the chief had sown good grain?  Because the farmer
said he had planted good grains, but they went to the field and found the bad growing up
with the good grain.
\tst Tst3:  This was simplified to, "One day, the workers went to the farm and found the bad
weeds with the good.  ...."   In tst2 retelling also, the "workers of the owner of the farm"
was simplified to "the workers".  This phrase can be simplified.  In tst2, they do include
the fact that they went to "visit" (check on) the field.  This phrase will remain.  Both
testing groups stated the question to the chief in the line well.  Revised.

\anc mat.13:27
\cn MM:  The word for "weeds" is a generic term for grass.  It is all encompasing - anything
bad that grows up from the ground that farmers would not like.
\tst Tst3:  This was omitted in retelling.  It was also omitted from Tst2 retelling.  While this
line seems to connect the dialogue flow between lines 8 and 10, it does not seem
necessary and does not seem to distract from the natural flow of conversastion based on
retellings.  It can be deleted.  However, after discussing with crafter, he chose to leave
this in and retold it in final crafting.

you want us to pull out these weeds out of the farm?"
\anc mat.13:28
\tst How did the farmer know it was by the enemy?  Because the enemy doesn't do good
work.  He knew he had planted good grain in the field.  The bad got there because the
enemy is bad.
\tst Tst3:  In both tst3 and tst2 retellings, the workers respond more simply by saying, "Do
we pull the weeds?".  Neither of the retellings re-state "Chief" here.  This line can be
simplified as in the retellings "Do we pull the weeds?"  Revised.

are going to pull some growth also.

the weeds you are going to pull some growth also.
\anc mat.13:29
\tst Tst3:  Why would he let them grow together?   Because he doesn't want to kill the good
grains - they will grow together and when the crops are old, the harvestors will tie up the
bad and burn them.

\anc mat.13:30
\cn MM:  While the concept of letting the weeds grow up with the wheat, is one that makes
sense to us, as I struggle to tell the difference between wheat and weeds.  However, this
concept is slightly more foreign to the Supyire as they are farmers. Working the field
and pulling the weeds is child's work.  They pull weeds as they come up.  However, in
testing, it was understood that this final harvest represented the end of the world when
the "good" people will be separated from the "bad people".
\tst Why did he tell them to wait to pull up the weeds?  Because they would pull up some
good ones with the bad.  Wait until harvest comes .... (retold ending of farmer parable).

Jesus was saying in this parable.  They wanted to understand..
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, he stated, "When Jesus was finished with his words, he entered the
house.  His students then asked him about hsi words."   The last part of this phrase can
be deleted, "about the weeds and the growth".  The testing respondent does retell the
word "parable" in previous lines above and the first part of this line will remain the

judges and chooses good from bad.  He takes the good to be with God and puts the bad
to burn in a fire.

one man said, "The world's going to end?"  Then the others discussed this with him....

'harvestors are God's angels" before the "harvesting is the end of the world" phrase.
While this testing respondent retold this part well, tst2 had difficults in retelling and had
to pause many times with this list.  One proposed change here:  Delete line 14, delete

am like the planter of good grain.  The end of the world will be like this harvesting.  At

\cn MM:  In revising this line, our craftor stated it in this manner.  He said it would be
unnatural for you to say the angel came and "sorted out" the bad ones.  The bad ones
are too numerous to "sort out".  It would be like "sorting out" rice from among pebbles. 
He also stated that if it were Jesus talking, Jesus would say "those who are mine" and
"my road" verses saying "God's road" because He and God are one.  This also makes an
important connection to the Assurance story to come and begins to plant seeds that
God's road and Jesus' road is one and the same.  Those on Jesus' road will enter God's
kingdom.

\tst Tst3:  In retelling, he uses the word "enemies" here, instead of "bad ones".  
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, they state "those who are believers" vs. "those who do not take God's
road."  They state, "Those who are believers will enter peace.  Those who do not take
God's road, will be burned in a fire that cannot be extinguished."
\tst This raises the question of using the terms "good ones and bad ones".  It may be most
natural to use "those who are on God's road" and "those who do not take God's road".

people will cry for themselves in that terrible place and grind their teeth because of their
great pain. This may also imply anger (Newman). This implies that they will not die but
will continue to suffer."
\tst Why were they crunching their teeth?  Is this good?   "It's not good to crunch their
teeth.  People do it when they don't have anything to eat or drink."
\tst Testing Group of Men:  Said, they are crunching/grinding their teeth because they are
filled with sorrow and regret.  They miss God.  It's a Senufo proverb that is understood

good thing - to be like the sun?"  "Yes.  In this case, yes.  To stay in God's kingdom, and
shine light like the sun."
\tst Testing Group of Men:  "Why will the good ones shine like the sun?"  Because they did
good things and now will be helped by God.  They are happy because they are with
God.  And - they're not in the fire and not crunching their teeth - they're full of joy
because they're with God.
\tst Tst3:  How will the good ones shine like the sun?  Because they will be in God's
kingdom.  They will be clean and praising God.

generic, because in one of our previous trainings we crafted this story and had a great
deal of difficulty with the concept of them going across the sea. Since large bodies of
water are not known here it is a confusing concept.
\tst Tst3:  Why was Jesus going to a village?  To say God's words to the people there.  Why? 
Because they should take God's road.
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, he retells this line more naturally by saying, "Jesus and his students
travelled to another village.  There in that place, there was a man possessed by
demons."  Tst4 also does a similar simplification.  It will be adjusted. Revised.

\tst Why would the man live in grave yard?  Because the demons had him and he was not
correct (He was not in his correct state of mind).
\tst Tst3:  How did they know he was possessed by demons?  Because he lived in the
cemetary.  He ran around.  He had his hands tied up, but he was too strong with the

\tst What happens to people when they are possessed by demons?  They are irrated,
disturbed, they scream and cry out a lot.   Do they get violent?  sometimes.
\tst Why did people try to tie him up?  Because his head and heart were bad.  His head had
left him because of the demons.  
\tst Tst3:  Why did the people tie his hands and feet with chains?  So he would stay at home,
but he was too strong and kept breaking them, running off to live in the fields or the
cemetary.
\tst Tst3:  How did he cut through them?  The demons helped him to do it.  They were very
strong.  They would make him turn and twist his hands until he could break/cut the
chains.

\cn BK:  Kneeling in front of someone is done to show respect.
\tst Why would the man kneel in front of Jesus?  Because he knew who Jesus was.  
\tst Tst3:  Why did the man run to Jesus?  Because he knew that God's Son had come.  How
did he know this?  Because they said the savior would come to save them, and save him
by chasing the demons out of the man.

just be there walking around - but Jesus was going to the village and saw the man.

simplification.
\tst Tst4:  She does not state, "God's Above Son", but "Father God's Son."  She also
rephrases the question to "Why have you come here?"
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, both times, he added a phrase, "What are you doing here?"  This,
along with the testing questions, seems to indicate a misunderstanding of the scripture
meaning of "What do you want with me?" or "Do not torment me."  It may be best to
restate this so the order is also clear chronologically ... When Jesus was telling the
demons to leave the man, he cried out, "Leave me alone Jesus - Son of God.  Do not

demons to leave the man with force because he wanted the demons to leave the man,
so he could be healthy and with Jesus.

had entered and he wants the man to be healthy, to stay at home with his family, and

know demons.  The same way they entered the man.  The pigs didn't know.  They could

calm.
\tst Tst3:  Why is this thing strange?  Because Jesus had cast the demons out of the man into

to sit correctly, and quietly, and then said, "I now sit calm, like the man was doing.  He
was like this because he was now without the demons, they had left him.
\tst Tst3:  Why did the people go and tell about this?  Because Jesus had cast the demons
out of the man.  This is astonishing.  The pig watchers were tellings people, so they
came to see this true thing that Jesus had done.  They saw it and were astonished.  Now
they are going and telling about it.
\tst Tst3:  This line could be simplified to "They saw the man who was possessed by demons

was not good that the pigs died?  Is Jesus good?  Yes, he healed the man.  This was
good.

They did not want to take his road, they were on their own road.  Jesus was only one
man when the whole village couldn't control him.  Only Jesus made the demons leave. 
The man was healthy.  Here, this whole village would be scared if this happened here.  If
this happened tomorrow, everybody would be scared.  The demons listened to only
Jesus, only Jesus.
\tst Tst3:  In his retelling, he changes the sentence structure to state, "They were afraid and

that.

Savior that had come.  Everybody knew the Savior was coming, but it was Jesus.  Jesus
did this.  Only Jesus could save him.  Jesus saved him when he made the demons leave
him, now he is not tied up, out in the field or living in the cemetary, but he is healthy and

\tst Tst3:  How could Jesus help his daughter?  He could pray to God and ask God not to let
the child die.  Jesus is God's Son, so if Jesus prays and asks for his daughter to be well

death and for the happy similarity between awaking someone from sleep and the miracle
of raising the girl that he is about to perform
\tst Tst3:  Why does Jesus say the child is not dead, she is sleeping?  Because the child
would not die.  Jesus said she was just sleeping so she was.  Jesus knew that he could
get her up.  He knew he could pray and God would answer.  But he didn't have to pray. 
He just touched her, put his hand on her, and told her to get up.

\tst Testing Group 2:  What part do you like about the story?  When the woman is healed
after touching Jesus' clothes, the woman is "right", Jesus tells the woman to go, Jesus

finished.  Jesus gives happiness/peace.

your foot and holds you.  They want to trap Jesus because of the true things he is doing.

the darkness car can steal/take anyone from Jesus‚Äô car.  Jesus‚Äô people cannot be pulled

\tst Tst2:  How did God give Jesus his sheep?  Because God knew Jesus would give them his
words, Jesus is the only one.  
\tst Tst2:  How is he stronger than anyone in the world?  God gave the sheep to Jesus
because he gives them God's Words.  God's Words and God's strength is above/over the
world .  God gave his sheep to Jesus - He has made Jesus stronger for them.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he restates a second time, "I will give life forever to my sheep.  God
gave them to me."  This is most likely performance error as he then continues and

\tst General Testing Comments:  In the initial testing of this story, the story was understood
and was easy to retell.  Unfortunately, some of the connections between this story and
other stories in our story set were not made (i.e. between the Isaiah prophecies and
what Jesus tells his students and the promise that God gives David to provide from his
offspring a king forever).  However, we realize that the testing of these stories have
been somewhat sporadic and not always chronological.  Hopefully, the connection will be
clearer in future storying groups.

mean "Have pity on me."
\tst Why does the blind man shout this?  He knows Jesus is strong and can heal him.  Why
does he call Jesus, 'Jesus of David's offsprings people'?  Because David and Jesus are
from the same group of people.

David's offspring to come to him and to open his eyes.  Why did he rise?  Because he
wants Jesus to hear and understand what hs is asking him.  You can sit and yell but your
words will not go far.  You have to stand to be heard - when you stand, your words go
further and people hear you.  He could sit, but he wanted Jesus to hear him and have
pity on him.

to come from David's offspring people, so Jesus was from David's Offspring people.

had the medicine that could give him his eyes.  What is Jesus' medicine?  Jesus can say
it and open his eyes.  Jesus says it and he can see.
\tst Tst2:  In the retelling, they leave out the "rose up".  This can be cut from the story.  One
person said the blind man said, "Open my eyes."  The other one corrected her and said,
"Have pity on me."  They did include the "Jesus of David's offspring's people" in the

\tst Tst3:  Why did they tell the man to be silent?  Because they are bad and they don't want
Jesus to help the man by opening his eyes.  They are afraid if Jesus opens his eyes
Jesus will leave and they don't want that.
\tst Tst3:  What did they see and hear for them to become sad?  They heard the blind man
yelling to Jesus, for Jesus to have pity on him, but that was bad for them.  They didn't
want his eyes opened so they told him to be quiet.
\tst Tst2:  In the retelling, they stated, "It was not good for them and they said to be
silent."  
\tst Tst3: Line was retold as is.  However, based on questioning and the emphasis on their
thinking that the people were this man's enemies and did not want him healed, this part

he wanted to see.  So Jesus said, "See" and he could.  Jesus saved him.  Now he can
see and work and eat.  How do you think Jesus was able to do this? Jesus is God's Son -
he is the Savior.  So jesus just had to say it because he is God's Son.  All he did was say
it, he put the blessing on the blind man and he could see.  Jesus could say "See", and
the man could, because he is Jesus.
\tst Tst3:  While in tst2 this line was retold as is.  In this testing retelling, he said, "Jesus said

and can now see.  Because the man believed enough to ask Jesus.

trusted Jesus because he heard the Savior was coming and was Jesus.  So Jesus saved

his eyes.  So, now he wants to follow him because Jesus is the medicine for you when

to ride into the city Jerusalem.  It is good for him because he is Lord. Because Jesus is
the king.  He should ride on it, and not walk.  He is God's Son- the king.
\tst Tst2:  How did Jesus know there would be a young donkey tied there?  Because he was

donkeys, but this one had never been ridden.  He had been born and was grown up, but
not old yet.

\anc luk.19:31
\cn MM:  The Supyire word for "Lord" is only used in Christian context and does not have
much meaning outside of Christian circles.  Therefore, instead of using the word for
"Lord" here, we have gone with a more generic term that means "Master or Teacher"."
\tst Tst2:  Why would the owner ask them what they are doing?  Because it was his donkey
and he wanted to know what they were going to do with it.  Why did he let them? 
Because they told him it was for the Lord, it was for Jesus.  When they told him they had
been sent for it, he let thim go.
\tst Tst2:  Why would Jesus need a young donkey?  Because it is good for him to ride it into
Jerusalem.  Jesus is going to ride on it and they can put their things on it.
\tst Tst3:  In her retelling, she said, "The Teacher needs it."  And does not use the word for
"Lord" here.  
\tst Tst2:  In his retelling, he uses the word "Lord".  Here, in this context, the word for "Lord"
simply means "Master".  Here in Supyire, this word means Master, similar to chief.  In
this context, the word "Lord" can remain in the story as it is not the same as "Christ, or
'Lord Jesus' or Lord God Almighty."
\ln 42.07a
\bt So they went as Jesus said they found they donkey tied there and
they untied it. 
\anc Luk.19:32
\tst Tst2 Why did they go and do as Jesus said?  Because Jesus sent them.  He was over

ride a donkey, but they don't as much.  People now go by motorcycle and trucks.

been sent for it, he let thim go.

\tst Tst2:  How could they be songs of joy?  They had joy because of the things that Jesus
had done.  They had joy and they were singing because Jesus was going with them to
Jerusalem.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, this was omitted.  
\tst Tst3:  In her retelling, she states, "They do this because the strange things Jesus has

Jesus, his Son, to be their king.  Jesus as king was good for them.  Jesus was like God
and spoke God's Words to them.  He had done good things for them.
\tst Tst2;  How did God send the king?  Because God had sent Jesus to them to be king and

\tst Tst2:  Why were the people shouting?  They were shouting because of the joy they had
for all that Jesus had done for them.  They were shouting because when you shout
everybody hears and understands.

\tst Tst2:  Why did the people of God's praying house call Jesus "Teacher"?  Because they

\tst How can "stones shout"?  that if the discples and people don't shout they will in their
place.
\tst In talking about the "stones shouting out" in testing their was a bit of discussion, why and
how the stones could shout.  It was decided that it is a type of proverb to show that the
people had to shout about Jesus, because even here in the thickest of traditional religion
they had not heard of stones shouting before.
\tst Tst2:  How can stones shout?  When people aren't shouting, the stones can make the
noise like the wind chime or keys hitting together.  The stone would make the noise.
\tst Tst2:  Why would the stones shout?  Because Jesus said if the people don't shout out, the
stones would be like them - they would shout, like them, about Jesus.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he stated, "If my disciples are silent, the stones will shout in their
place." 
\tst Tst3:  In her retelling also, she states, "If my disciples are silent, the stones will shout in

\tst Why did Jesus cry for the city?  Because they don't know and like God and his work. 
Because the enemy is going to come and kill them.
\tst Note:  Jesus crying was one part of the story that they did not like.  Crying is a hard
thing here, more times than not, the Supyire people do not cry.  This occasion for Jesus
to cry shows it had to be very heavy on him for him to cry.
\tst Tst2:  Why would Jesus cry for the city?  Jesus was crying for Jerusalem because they
were broken and his heart was raised for them, like when you want something and it is
broken - you cry for it.
\ln 42.19
\bt Why?  Because he said that, "God has sent me to place a good

\old Why?  Because he said that, "if you knew how to get peace you would {accept} it. 
Why?  Because God came to help you and you refuse.
\anc luk.19:42, TW TN's on Luke says that "Jesus was not talking about literal eyes. He was
talking about their ability to understand spiritual truth. They didn‚Äôt accept Jesus as the
way to that peace, so it was too late for them. God had hidden that truth from them. As
a result, they could neither understand it nor experience it."
\tst Why did Jesus say the people had refused God?  Because they think the road is not good
for them.  Jesus came for them to know God's road.
\tst Tst2:  How could they have peace?  They cannot because they refused it, they refused
Jesus and God's Words.
\tst Tst2:  How did God come to help them?  God sent Jesus to give them his words - when
you listen to God's Words and do his work, God will help you when you are working for
him.  Why did they refuse?  Because they did not accept Jesus' words.  His words were
not good for them and when words are not good for you, you just refuse them.  You
don't listen and accept.  That's what they did.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, this was simplified to, "They refused my peace.  They don't know it. 
They could have known it, but they refused."
\tst Tst3:  In her retelling, again this phrase was shortened to "If you knew how to get
peace, you would be praising God."   This phrase is misunderstood and should be
reworked and can be stated, "He said, "God sent me to put a good relationship between
you and God.  But you did not believe in me."  This also emphasizes the relationship
theme that belief in Jesus can offer good relationship (peace) with God.  Revised.

enemy soldiers would enter the town and kill the people. (2) The enemy soldiers would
break down the town itself, including the walls and the houses.
\tst Tst2:  Why will the enemy come to circle, press, and kill them?  Because they have
refused God's words.  
\tst Tst2:  How can an  enemy do this?  Because since God's Words are not good for them,
God will let the enemy come and circle, press, destroy, and kill them.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he does not state "press them."

\tst Tst2:  Why was Jesus saying God's Words in all of God's prayer house?  So that the

\tst Tst2:  Why did the people there want to kill him?  Because Jesus' words were for

\tst General Testing Comments:  It seems clear in testing the portions of the story regarding
the betrayal of Jesus and why Judas is betraying him.  It is clear the example of servant
leadership that Jesus sets.  However, it seems somewhat unclear the connection
between the bread and Jesus' body, the drink and Jesus' blood and God's new covenant. 
These are difficult concepts and do not seem well understood in the first testing session. 
The connection between Jesus' upcoming death on the cross and this last supper do not
seem to be made.  Any advice you may have, and how to anchor it, would be
appreciated.  Also, the story is long, making retelling difficult.
\p
\co Revised 7/7/08
\p
\co This story has been revised.  The plot has been developed further, adding details to
the plot of Judas' to kill Jesus.  The teaching section of the story, the washing of the
disciples feet, has been removed to shorten the story and increase it's re-tellability. 
The story flows and concentrates more on the plot to kill Jesus, His willingness and
knowledge of his upcoming death, and the significance of his death for everyone. 
Overall, the story flows better and ties better into the next story.

\cn BK:  "Looking for a reason" means they were seeking for a motive to "kill him".  
\tst What do you think the religious leaders doing?  They wanted to take Jesus - we can't
know why, but many of these people want Jesus to die without others knowing.  It is
treason - kill because they don't like Jesus.
\tst Tst2:  Why did the people from God's praying house want to kill Jesus?  Because of the
words Jesus was teaching.  The people listened to Jesus' words a lot and this was not
good for them.
\tst Tst2:  How were they doing it secretly?  Because they wanted to kill Jesus and if they did
it for everybody to know, it would not be good for them because they don't want the
people to know so the people won't kill them.
\tst Tst2:  Why did they not succeed?  Because Jesus was good for all the people.  If they
were to kill Jesus, the people would kill them.

what he said was right.
\tst Tst3:  She retold this line as is.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he states "Why?  Because Jesus was good for the people" (in this case
"good for the people" means "loved by the people".  This would be a good natural phrase
here to explain further why they could not kill Jesus at this moment. Revised.

\cn MM:  Final read through, showed the need to continue to unpack the concept of "Satan". 
Will say, "One day, Satan, God's enemy ..."
\tst Who is Judas?  One of Jesus' 12 disciples.  
\tst Tst2:  How did Satan enter Judas?  Because his head is not good.  He wanted to kill
Jesus like the people from God's praying house.  They wanted to kill Jesus.  Satan
entered Judas because of the badness he had in him.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he omits, "Iscariot, one of Jesus 12' disciples."
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, she states, "Judas, one of Jesus' 12 disciples."  There is no need to
state "Iscariot" here.  It is difficult to pronounce.  Revised.
\tst Tst2 (retest):  What do you think of when you hear "Satan"?  Satan wants to kill people
here.  When I hear Satan I think he wants to hurt, break, and kill people.  He wants you
to do bad things and not be right, not to do good things.  That is what I think when I hear
"Satan" here.
\tst Tst2 (retest):  Why did Satan enter Judas?  Satan entered Judas because Satan wants
Jesus delivered over to the enemies hands so he will be killed.  Satan knew the enemies
of Jesus wanted to kill him.  He also wanted to kill Jesus, so he entered Jesus.  Why?  So
Judas could put Jesus into their hands.

\tst Why did Judas want to kill Jesus?  Satan came on Judas.
\tst Tst2:  How did Judas know that the leaders of God's prayer house wanted to kill Jesus? 
Judas knew because he had heard them say how Jesus was not good for them.  He knew
this, but Jesus was not good for him too, so he could give Jesus to them and they would
give him money - that was good for Judas.
\tst Tst2:  Why would he hand over Jesus?  Because Jesus is not good for him.  Jesus was
his boss and the words and the things Jesus did were not good for him, so he could give
Jesus to them.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he omits "the chief of God's praying big house guardians" - these will
be summarized and left as "the leaders of God's praying house" for cohesive nature of
keyterms within story set.  Revised.

\bt They were very glad.  So they proposed him a sum of money.
\anc luk.22:05
\tst Who is "they"? The religious leaders. "Him"?  Judas.
\tst Tst2:  Why were they glad?  Because it was good for them to kill Jesus now.  
\tst Tst2:  Why would they give Judas money?  Because when you work for someone, you
pay them.  Judas was doing this for them, so they will give him his money.
\ln 44.06b
\bt From that day Judas was thinking about how to take Jesus to them.
\anc luk.22:06
\cn BK:  "Thinking" here is like "planning" how to take Jesus.  
\tst Tst2:  Why would Judas think how he can give them Jesus?  He thought all the time how
he could give Jesus to them and the thought about the money they had given him.  He
thought how he would take Jesus, like you take something from a person.
\tst Tst2 (retest):  Why was Judas thinking about how to take Jesus to them?  He was
thinking about how to take Jesus to them because he was Jesus' student.  Jesus was his
teacher.  He would be with Jesus.  When Satan entered him, and the enemies gave him
money to take Jesus to them, that is all that he thought about, how to take Jesus to
them.

\old After that, Jesus and his disciples sat around the food and started eating.  
\anc luk.22:14
\tst What happened next?  After that, Jesus and people began to eat - they are all around
(drew a circle on ground).
\tst Tst2:  Why would Jesus and his disciples sit around and eat?  Because they were one. 
They had been together, learning as one so they sat to eat as one.
\tst Tst:  Based on the misunderstanding that they had already started eating here, the can
be rephrased, to "After that, Jesus and his disciples sat around the food."  Revised.
\ln 44.08
\bt Then Jesus said, "I want to do this ceremony with you before I
suffer."  
\old Jesus said, ‚ÄúI decided inside myself,  to eat the food of this ceremony with you before I
suffer
\anc luk.22:15
\tst What do you think Jesus says here and why?  "I think when we finish eating, I will not be
happy."  He knows after he eats treason will happen.  Because he knows the treason is
getting ready to happen, they will take him.
\tst Tst2:  How did Jesus "decide inside" himself?  It was inside of him.  Like when you eat, it
goes inside of you.  Jesus decided - like how we said we were going to work.   You ask
me, and I said yes.  I accepted that you wanted to work, so after that Jesus decided
what they would do.
\tst Tst2:  How is this food for a ceremony?  Because when you have ceremonies or feasts,
you have food.  It's good for the people.
\tst Tst2:  Why will Jesus suffer?  Because the enemies will come for him and take him and
make him suffer and kill him.  
\tst Tst3:  In her retelling, she states, "I want to do this ceremony with you" This may be a
good simplification for the first part of the line.  Revised.

\co When asked what the phrase "to do that in front of you" means, it was explained in
the BT that it means that Jesus has set an example for the disciples to follow.
\tst Re-Back-translate this sentence:  "Work I do for you, you do this same work, then you
find peace."  It is very good - after the work, peace comes.

\anc jhn.13:15 , 17
\tst Referring to the entire "foot washing" section, why does Jesus do this?  It is like a
proverb of who works and who is in charge.  You know you are in charge, but you can
and you do the work of the workers.  Jesus says - me and you, no many different. 
Jesus gives this work - Jesus begins a work that is not finished - everybody is the same. 
Jesus washed their feet - why?  because they will not forget.
\ln 44.16
\bt Then Jesus took some bread, praised {KT: praise} God, and cut it and
gave it to them. 
\anc luk.22:19
\tst Tst2:  Why did Jesus praise God?  Because of the things and food he had given to them. 
Jesus took the bread and broke it and gave it to them.  So they praised God.
\ln 44.17
\bt And said, " This bread is like my body.  When you eat this, remember
me."  
\old And said, "Eat this bread.  It's my flesh.  And remind yourself to me."
\anc luk.22:19
\cn BK:  Jesus did this because Jesus was about to suffer.  They would be reminded of him
from now on when they eat the bread.
\tst Why does Jesus do and say this?  Why does he say the bread is his flesh?  He wants his
students to all the time repeat and know and not forget.  Because if his flesh is bread,
then all the time they will eat it and not forget.
\tst Tst2:  How can this bread be Jesus' flesh?  Because Jesus was giving his life and flesh for
them.  So that when they eat his bread, they will remember Jesus.  They will eat the
bread and think of Jesus' flesh.  They will sweat and think of him.  How can this remind
people of Jesus?  Because if Jesus gives them bread - they ate and became full.  Jesus
gave them that bread - they cannot forget Jesus and all he will do for them.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he states, "Think of me."  Instead of "remind yourself to me." 
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, she states, "When you eat this, think about me."  This line can be
changed to "This bread is like my flesh, which I will give for you.  When you eat this,
think about me."   Revised.  Craftor stated it would not be understood to say "I give for
you".  He also felt it more appropriate to use the "remember me" phrase.  This was
retold in final retesting as is.
\ln 44.18
\bt Then he took water of fruit, and gave it to them.  And said for them to
drink it.  
\old And after that he took the cup, there was water of grapes in it, and gave it to his
disciples and said, "Drink this water of grape."  Grape is a tree which fruit [MM: fruit from
a tree] can be water.
\anc luk.22:20
\tst How can this phrase be explained?  A grape is fruit from a tree, small fruit you get the
water out of to drink.  It is good to say it like this because many people say Christians
drink beer and get drunk.  "Resin" (grape) is a word they won't know, but "fruit from a
tree" they will know.
\tst Tst2:  Why did Jesus give them the water of grapes to drink?  Because when you eat
things you have to drink something after.  Why grape water?  The grape water because
Jesus is going to die and give his blood for their bad things.  All of this is a part of the
sign of God's alliance with them.
\tst Tst2:  In retelilng, he states, "Then he gave them grape water and told them to drink it. 
The drink grape water is from a tree you drink the fruit of."
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, she states, "And gave them grape water to drink.  And said drink
this.  This is fruit water.  
\tst Tsts:  Based on retellings, this line is too complicated and unpacked for retelling.  It may
be best to simplify this to, "Then, he gave them fruit water to drink.  And said, "Drink
this fruit water. ..."  The word for "fruit" is something easily understood here.  There
seems to be no need to unpack the French word for "grape" here.  Revised.
\ln 44.19
\bt And said, "This water is like my blood.  I will die for your {sins}." 
\old And said, "If you drink that, remind yourself to God's new {alliance} that he links
because of my shed blood."
\anc luk.22:20, TN suggests "And he said, ‚ÄúThis cup of wine represents the new promise that
God gives to people which my life blood makes possible."  See also anchor for line 44.20.
\tst Tst2:  How can drinking that remind them of God's alliance?  Because Jesus told them so
that they could be one and they would not forget what Jesus was doing for them.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he simplifies this to, "God gave us this alliance, the grape water will
be my blood."   
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, she skips ahead to line 20 here.  She omits this line.   
\tst Tsts:  Based on lack of retellability, this line and line 20 could be restated as, "This is like
my blood.  I will die for your bad actions.  My blood will shed so that you can have life
forever.  When I die, God's new alliance with you begins.  That is, if you believe in me,
you will be saved.  There will be a good relationship between you and God."  This
unpacks it clearly, using cohesive terms and phrasing used throughout the story set. 
See additional anchoring here and in line 20 from TW. Revised.
\ln 44.20
\bt "When I die, God will place a new alliance [MM:  {relationship}]
between you and Him.  That is, if you {trust} in me, you will be saved

and God."
\old "The sign of God's new alliance is, "I, Jesus, will die in the name of your bad actions
{KT: sin}.  My blood will shed so that you can have life forever."
\anc luk.22:20 ,  TN suggests, "I am about to shed/lose it for your (plur) sakes."  TN also
states, " This new agreement or promise is that God will save all those who trust in Jesus
as the sacrifice for their sins (Romans 3:25)."
\tst MM:  Why they were drinking the water of grapes? BK:  Like Jesus' blood, the juice of
grape is red.  This would remind them of God's new alliance with them - the alliance is
Jesus' shed blood.
\tst What do you think is God's new covenant?  God's ceremony - God brings back Jesus
after death.  Alliance is like when you give a promise between people or villages. 
(covenant is same as promise).  Jesus will come back.  Why does Jesus say the drink is
to remind us of his blood?  So that you don't forget.  The drink is red, like his blood.
\tst Tst2:  Why is Jesus going to shed his blood?  Because Jesus is going to be killed for them
- so when they drink this , they will not forget that.
\tst Tst2:  Why will Jesus die in the name of their bad actions?  Because Jesus will accept all
the bad things of people.  He will save them from their bad things - he will die for them.
\tst Tst2:  How can Jesus' blood give life forever?  Because Jesus will be giving his blood for
theirs.  Jesus will be killed so they will not.  Jesus' blood is not like ours.  Jesus will come
back to life, so we won't die.
\tst Tst2:  How is this an alliance with God?  Because Jesus will die and will come back.  This
is a sign that is from God.  
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he states, "I will die and rise from death.  My blood will shed to give
life forever to you."  
\tst Tst3:  She states this line as "I will die and rise.  I will die in the name of your bad
actions.  My blood will shed so that you can have life forever."
\tst Tst:  Based on testings and retellings, see proposed revision in line 19 above.    Revised.

\bt After that, Jesus said, "There is someone here with us who is going to
hand me over in the enemies' {KT: enemy} hands.
\anc luk.22:21 , TN suggests "Then Jesus said, ‚ÄúBut listen, the one who is about to deliver me
to my enemies ..."
\tst Tst2:  How did Jesus know someone will hand him over to the enemy?  He knew this
because when he was with them and teaching, he knew that they were not one - he and
Judas.  Satan had entered Judas and he was looking for a way to give the enemies
Jesus.
\tst Tst2:  Why is this "someone" there with Jesus?  Judas was there with them because he
was looking for a way to give Jesus to the enemies - he was there with the disciples
because he was one of the 12, but he was there watching.
\ln 44.22
\bt God decided that [MM:  I will be killed], but the one who is going to do
this bad action {KT: sin} to me, it is finished for him.
\anc luk.22:22 , TN suggests "I, the man from God, will die. God has already decided that."
\cn BK:  "Finished for him" means that like a punishment, the betrayor will suffer.
\tst Why does Jesus say that "God decided that I will be killed"?  Jesus says, "God proposes I
die"- why?  Because Jesus knows what God wants and can do.  God can kill him because
God is strong.
\tst What will happen to this enemy who hands Jesus over?  He is going to be broken.  
\tst Tst2:  Why did God decide to kill Jesus?  Because Jesus is his Son.  When he dies, he will
go and be with God again.  God sent Jesus as the Savior.
\tst Tst2:  How is it finished for the one who does the bad action?  Because he is broken and
he is not coming back to Jesus.  He is gone from them.  His insides are broken.  He will
suffer and be gone.  God will let him be this way.
\tst Tst2:  In retelling, he omits "God decided that I will be killed."  Also in retelling, instead
of stating "the one who is going to do this bad action to me", he states, "the one who will
give me to the enemies hands...".
\tst Tst3:  She does include "God decided that I will be killed."  She also keeps the original
phrasing of "the one who is going to do this bad action to me ..."  This line will remain as
is in the story.
\ln 44.23
\bt When he has finished saying that, his disciples were asking
themselves, "Among us, who will accept to do that bad action?"
\anc luk.22:23
\tst Tst2:  Why did the disciples ask themselves who could accept to do this bad action? 
Because they didn't believe it was possible for one of them to do this to Jesus.
\tst Tst2:  How could a disciple of Jesus want to do this bad thing against him?  Because
when Jesus is dead and gone, that one thinks he can come and be in Jesus' place - but
he cannot.  He is finished/broken.
\tst Tst2 and Tst3: In retelling, this was retold as original.

\t Judas' Betrayal 
\co Supyire
\p
\co Redemptive Theme:  While the enemy Satan is against Jesus, he has no power over
him.  Jesus is the more powerful victor.
\co Basic Biblical concepts :  Power of prayer, Jesus is handed over to be killed , Jesus
willingly accepted his upcoming death
\co Cohesion / Background:  Story continues with the day of the "fete", continues to
build on Jesus' foreknowledge of his upcoming death, builds on the relationship
between Father and Son, Jesus.  The religious leader's plot to kill Jesus continues as
they have come to take him.  The understanding of the enemy "Satan" is expanded
by referring to him as the "owner of darkness".
\co Worldview/Selection:  Again, as power is sought after through many different means
within Supyire culture, the power of prayer to "win the enemy" is seen within the
story.

about future events.  Jhn.14:10 - Jesus' words are words of authority from the Father.

true.
\tst Tst3:  How can he come back?  He will die and 3 days later come back because God said
he will.  It is God's will.  Like if you go on a trip and come back.  Jesus said he will come

because God can save him.  God is his Father.  He is big - he created the entire world -
God can save him.
\tst Tst3:  Why does Jesus not want his own will to happen?  Because God is His Father.  He

will suffer.

gave him strength and power, he knew Satan was coming to take him and make him

Satan.  Jesus was praying with anger - anger, you know, when you do not respond when
someone is talking to you or when you say you are going to beat someone and mean it.

\t Death of Jesus
\co Supyire
\p
\co Redemptive Theme:  Jesus has power to give people life above with God, to save
those who seek salvation from Him.
\co Basic Biblical concepts:  Jesus is handed over to be killed.  He is beaten and
crucified.  Dead and buried.  The story points to the consequences of sin are death
(as criminal points out), but points also to the forgiving power of God.
\co Cohesion / Background:  Relationship between Father and Son continues to be built. 
The time of "darkness" has arrived and is cohesively linked to the "owner of
darkness" in the story before thorugh the earth becoming "dark" here.  Isaiah
prophecy is fulfilled - Jesus is beaten and killed.  Cohesively draws out Jesus' status
as "King" and "Savior they were waiting for (Christ)".

conquering death and sin.  There is forgiveness of sins for those who believe in
Jesus, leaving old roads behind and taking Jesus' road.
\co Basic Biblical concepts: Jesus rises from death and goes above to God.  Promise of

"ghost".  It is the expression used in the Supyire NT translation in this anchor vs for
"ghost".
\cn From testing respondent:  A "ghost" is said to be what happens to you when you die and
your "body is gone". The spirit is not dead.  It does not have arms or legs, it does not
have flesh and bone and cannot eat.  It is not a demon or an angel.
\tst Tst3:  Why does Jesus say, "It is not a spoiled body"?  Because he was dead.  When you

dead.  They are scary.  Young people cannot see them because they are young, but old
men can see them.  Here at night.  They walk in the darkness.  Old men see them

for food and they gave him fish to eat.  Then he ate it.  Because when you suffer you
become hungry or if it had been a long time since he had eaten, you become hungry.

\co Redemptive Theme:  It is through belief in Jesus, that one can be forgiven and saved
by God.  God's victorious power can be received by those who have a good
relationship with Him by believing in Jesus.
\co Basic Biblical concepts:  Jesus died and 3 days later rose again, coming of God's
Spirit on Jesus' followers, forgiveness, repentence, baptism, communion of believers.
\co Cohesion / Background:  Continue to build concept of receiving power directly from
God through His Spirit.  Cohesively restates that the Jesus whom they crucified was
the Savior they were waiting for.  Calls people to repentence by believing in Jesus,
leaving their old road and taking Jesus' road for the forgiveness of sin.  Introduces

surprised to hear it, surprised to hear their own language.    (NOTE, Since this testing,
Line 05 has been revised to include "that they had not learned" to make it clearer that
these were not learned languages)
\tst Tst3:  How could they each hear their own language when the speakers are not from
their country?  Because Jesus did this.  He wanted everybody to hear and understand. 
When God speaks to you he says it in English, but when God speaks to me, he says it in
Supyire or Bambara.  Because Jesus wants them to understand.
\tst Tst3:  Why were they talking "about God"?  Because God's Spirit came down on them.  It
came down on them so they could speak God's Words.  Why?  God's words were good
for them to speak about.  Like now, you speak God's Words and they are good for me.
\tst Tst3:  In retelling he states, "People that were in the village came. Each person was
hearing his father's language talking about God."  Based on this retelling, it should be
included  that "People from all over the world were there.  When they came and heard
the words of the believers, they were astonished.  Why?  Because all of them were
hearing their father's language from the believers talking about God"   Retold after

\tst Why would they mock them?  Because they don't like the words they are saying
\tst Tst3:  Why were some mocking them?  They mocked them because the words they were

were understanding the other languages because of God's Spirit that came down on

this story and make it their own story of showing how God cares for them.  Why?

reading from the Bible - omitting the reference to Isaiah.  They also struggled with the
exact text from Isaiah,  taking a few moments to think and having several people
interject the lines slowly.  However, the connection was clearly gotten and made

because no one here knows where Ethiopia is, and we want this story to be most

character.  (They then retold this portion of text below from Isaiah.)

so he could explain - so he did. 
\tst Tst3:  How do you think the black man had part of God's messenger's Isaiah's book? 
Because the queen of his country gave it to him - she gave it to him so he could study

sheep, he doesn't talk - even when going to the killing place.  Jesus, he didn't talk when
they took him to kill him either.

speaks of Jesus.

\p
\co Redemptive Theme:  There can be a good relationship between God and people
through belief in Jesus.  How can one be saved?  Believe in Jesus.   Also, there is
access for the believers of Jesus to His victorious power over evil.  God acts
powerfully to provide for and save those in good relationship with Him.
\co Basic Biblical concepts:  Sharing the news of Jesus with others, baptism, God's
power over evil and over nature, persecution, praising God in midst of suffering,
power in prayer, fellowship of believers
\co Cohesion / Background:  Unpacks what Jesus' followers were doing when they were
"telling about Jesus" in cohesive terms relating to the way in which Jesus has
provided restored relationship with God.  Again, refers to those who follow Jesus as
"believers".  Ties in "those who take Jesus' road" with those who "trust" in Him.
\co Worldview/Selection:  Evil spirits are very much still present here in the everyday
world of the Senufo Supyire.  Therefore, this story importantly shows that there is a
way to have power over these evil spirits.

words that tell us to have faith in God.
\tst Tst3:  What is the "Good News"?  It is God's Words, they were walking and telling people
about Jesus.  This is good news - God's Word is good news.  Why?  Because Jesus gave
God's Words to his disciples and they are to walk and share these words.  It's good

remembered.  He also mistakenly said she was saying, "These are the saviors."  We will
relook at this section, possibly using repetition to make it clearer and more memorable. 
Or cohesively use what is used in line 01 to describe Good News as what the
demon-possessed girl is saying Paul and Silas are doing?
\tst Tst3:  In retelling, he does state, "These are God's workers", but states, "They are our
saviors."  The second half of this phrase needs reworking.

\tst How does Paul get the demon to leave?  He begs [prays to] God and the spirit leaves.

teacher.  He taught them so now they work in his name.  What does saying "In the name
of Jesus" do?  Because they work for Jesus, in his name.  If they had just said, "Demons
leave" they would not have left the woman but because they said "In Jesus name" the
demons knew who they were working for and left them.  How did the demons know Paul
and Silas worked for Jesus?  The people of Philippi knew because Paul and Silas had
come to tell them the words about Jesus.  They all knew that Paul and Silas were for
Jesus.

the demon left the servant woman."

are not good.  They want to mix-up their village.

The demon has left and there is no more work.  They can't get money anymore.  The
words/future left her.
\tst Tst3:  How did they make disorder?  Because they had made the demon leave the

there and put the demon out of the woman.  This was bad for some of the people of that
village - Paul and Silas made this disorder, so they went to the village leaders becaues
they wanted them to be beat.  So the took them and beat them.  Here, the other day,
when I went to eat lunch, I got to my house and a man had come to rob my neighbor -
they had him tied up.  They were going to beat him and put him in jail.  You don't cause
disorder here.

"take care of" is not in the "good" sense of the term, but to prevent them from fleeing
away.
\tst Tst3:  Why did the authorities tell the guardian to "guard them seriously"?  So that they
could not escape and go to another village.  They beat them and put them in the small

them and give them peace.  They weren't at peace in that place.  They wanted God to
give life back to them and take them out.
\tst Tst3:  Why were the other prisoners listening to Paul and Silas?  Because they were
praying to God  and praising him.  The others could not leave and they did not believe
them.  But they were scared because they were in prison.  So they listened a lot to

\tst Why did he ask them this?  He knew Paul and Silas knew God's road.  He wanted to be

accept God's road.
\tst Tst3:  Why would the guard want to be released from his sin?  Because he knew that
Paul and Silas were singing to Jesus and the earth shook and the doors opened.  He

\ln Futher Comments from Back-Translation Session
\tst What do you think people will understand from the story?  If the villagers listen to the
story, to my understanding, it will show them that the judgment here on earth is inferior
to God‚Äôs ones. Why?  Because if you take the case of Paul and Silas, they sent them to
jail and with God‚Äôs help, the earth starts shaking and all the doors open.  Why?  Because
God was following what Paul and Silas were doing.  It means they were right, but for
human beings they were wrong.  But God was the one who released them from the
hands of the unbelievers ‚Äì the guardian and the chiefs.  In sum, only God we should
trust.  He is the best judge.

\ln Further Comments from Testing Session in Village
\tst ‚Ä¢ What part do you like?  When Paul and Silas came to Lydie‚Äôs house, to the believers,

not like?  When they took Paul and Silas‚Äô clothes, beat them, and put them in prison. 
When they said Paul and Silas were turning the village upside down and they couldn‚Äôt
agree with their words.  ‚Ä¢ What does the story tell you about God?  We will praise God,
speak God‚Äôs words like Paul and Silas.  We trust God‚Äôs Words, they are true.    ‚Ä¢ What
does the story say about people?  Some people don‚Äôt like God‚Äôs road, some people don‚Äôt

Paul and Silas‚Äô work is good.  It was good when they made the demon leave her.  Even
though the owners were mad.  The owners are not good.

\co Redemptive Theme:  It is through belief in Jesus that one is on God's road and is
saved.  Those who believe in Jesus, God will save.  They will go above and be with
God forever because of the good relationship that Jesus has placed between them
and God.  God's power and ultimate provision are seen in giving man access to God's
power over death, providing man with everlasting life with God.
\co Basic Biblical concepts: persecution of believers, coming day of judgment , Jesus'
return, resurrection of the body, eternal life with God.
\co Cohesion / Background:  Jesus' followers continue sharing about Jesus.  There is still
evil in this world - presence of jealousy, evil spirits, the enemy Satan.  Reminder
that Jesus was the "Savior they were waiting for".
\co Worldview/Selection:  Based on the often synchronizing of religious beliefs and the
possibility of persecution and suffering from family and others, there is emphasis on
the words of Paul to the believers that they "turned their back on their fetishes" and
have believed in Jesus, not leaving His road even in suffering.

\tst Tst3:  Why did they talk about Jesus?  Because they want them to become Jesus'

the people.  So they would also be his disciples.
\tst Tst3:  This line was changed to say, "They went to Silas' village, and went to God's

about here?  Here, example, when you come to share God's Words and the chief likes it,

\tst Tst3 (retest):  Why is it good for us to have a good relationship with God?  Because
when we do have a good relationship, God helps us, we work as one - that is good for
us.  God will not put us in the fire to be burned.
\tst Tst3 (retest):  Why only the people who believe in Jesus will he save from the fire? 
Because they believe in Jesus, he will save them.  Those who believe in the fetishes will
find the fire.  Those who believe in Jesus will be with him and not in the fire, but all those
who do not believe in him will be in the fire that cannot be extinguished.
\tst ***Tst3 (retest):  In retelling, he states, "Why?  Because there is now a good
relationship between us and God."  As this is the only place in the story set where the
concept of "putting back together" is used, we will rephrase this to say in more natural
words, "Why?  Because those who believe in Jesus and take his road, have a good
relationship with God."  This cohesively ties the redemptive theme of belief in Jesus, to
being on Jesus' road, to being saved by God from His judgment, and gaining life forever
with God.  Also, in researching the concept of "restored" relationship within the NT draft,
it does not appear to use this word used above for "put back together" in the context of
relationship.  However, the draft simply states that is is because of Jesus, that there is
now a good relationship..."  See relationship in L&C Notes.

\bt After David became king and was settled in his palace,  
\anc 2Sa.07:01
\ln 01.02
\bt one day he was with his spiritual advisor, Nathan, and he said to him: 
Look!  Here I am living in this beautiful palace, but the place of
worshipping and the holy case for consulting God is out in a tent.
\anc 2Sa.07:02 
\ln 01.03
\bt Nathan said to him:  "Well, go ahead and do what you have in mind,
because God is with you. 
\anc 2Sa.07:03 
\ln 01.04
\bt But that night Nathan perceived from God that he was guiding him a
different way. 
\anc 2Sa.07:04 
\ln 01.05
\bt And he went back to David and said to him:
\anc 2Sa.07:17  
\ln 01.06
\bt <<Here is a message from God for you:  Who are you to build ME a
house? 
\anc 2Sa.07:05 (NLT) ìGo and tell my servant David, ëThis is what the Lord says: Are you the
one to build me a temple to live in?
\ln 01.07
\bt I chose you when you were just a shepherd boy taking care of your
sheep out in the pasture, and raised you up to be king of your people,
the Israelites.
\anc 2Sa.07:08 
\bt And I have gotten rid of your enemies. 
\anc 2Sa.07:09 
\ln 01.08
\bt Now  instead of you making ME a house, I am going to make YOU a
house, a royal "house" of David, a dynasty of kings that will go on for
all time.
\anc 2Sa.07:11 (the Lord will build his "house")
\anc 2Sa.07:16 (his dynasty will be permanent)
\ln 01.09
\bt You will have a son, and he will build my house, a temple where
people can worship me. And the line of his descendants will go on
being kings forever.>>
\anc 2Sa.07:12 -13
\cn Temple recurs in various stories.
\ln 01.10
\bt When David heard this, he went to the tent of worship, sat down in
God's presence, and prayed.  He said:  "Oh all-powerful God, Who am I
that you have brought me this far?
\anc 2Sa.07:18 
\cn NOTE: re. "went in to the tent" -- HBK says: The fact that he entered into the tent where
the ark was housed (see 6.17; 7.2) is implied in the expression "before the Lord"
\ln 01.11
\bt And now you are talking about the kingdom and rule of my
descendents going on forever.   
\anc 2Sa.07.19  
\ln 01.12 
\bt So may it happen just like you have promised.  
\anc 2Sa.07.25 
\ln 01.13 
\bt Because when you speak, it is the truth. And this is what you have
promised to me, your SERVANT.
\anc 2Sa.07.28  
\cn Servant becomes a sub-theme in this panorama, first with David referring to himself as
God's servant, then referring to the Messiah, and then with believers calling themselves
servants of God.
