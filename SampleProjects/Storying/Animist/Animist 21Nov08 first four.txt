\co Animist Set
\co Purpose:  This twelve-story panorama is an exploratory panorama used in training in the OneStory
partnership. It provides one sample of a short panorama that OneStory suggests be used as a discovery
tool -- a way of exploring worldview and socio-cultural issues with mother-tongue story crafters, starting
with a set of stories that the OneStory team may consider from an initial exposure to the people group to
be a useful starting point.  A completely different exploratory panorama would be constructed where the
broad worldview is e.g. Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Secular / Agnostic, or other broad worldview types.  Even
within these types, an initial panorama of this nature can be a uniquely designed tool that takes
advantage of what the OneStory team discovers in an initial discovery period of considering the unique
worldview and socio-cultural context of each people group.  So, for example, instead of the Elijah story
used here, this may be useful among an animist group where animal sacrifice is a part of the culture or
tradition, but in cases where sacrifice is unknown or abhorrent to a people group, it may be more helpful
for this initial exploratory set to use a story like Balaam, as an example of a shaman who experiences
God's over-ruling power; or Job as a priest making offerings for his family, and caught in the conflict of
Satan and God, or the Witch of Endor story, if consulting someone from the world of the dead is a known
concept
\co Selection issues:  This Creation story begins with the concept of where spirit beings in the world come
from.  In many animist contexts, and particularly where spirits are thought to be the souls of people who
have died, it may be helpful to have an initial composite story (or story section) that gives an alternate
(and biblical) view of where the spirit beings (both good and evil / angels and demons) come from.  The
short version given in lines 01-07 below is considered to be non-controversial (1) in avoiding reference to
the Isaiah 14 and Ezequiel 28 passages that some, but not most, exegetes think to be referring to Satan;
and (2) in avoiding the placement of the fall of the angels in a particular point in time (i.e. before the
creation of the world, versus after it, etc.).
\co Selection issues:  The part of this creation story that deals with the creation of the world and of people
uses the Genesis 2 account.  This is primarily done because the Genesis 2 account is more narrative and
memorable (less of a "list") than the Genesis 1 account. 
\co Redemptive Theme:  The primary redemptive theme use in this story set is that of Jesus as victor over
the spirit world, and particularly over the master of the evil spirits, Satan.  The redemptive theme shows
people calling on Jesus as the one having the power to rescue them from the darkness and death they
find themselves bound in.  This creation story introduces this theme by giviing the origins of the spirit
world as being created by God, but rebelling against him.
\co Basic biblical concepts:  God as creater of all things, physical and spiritual.  Rebellion against God (sin) as
something he doesn't tolerate, and that will be punished.
\co Cohesion:  This story introduces the instruction from God not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, as background for the next story "Fall".
\ln 01.01
\bt This is the true story that starts at the begining of time. We know what happened, even
way back then, because God raised up spokesmen to tell people about what had
happened.

"angel" is given as "messenger of/from God".

put them in. 
\anc Jud.01:06; Jas.02:19, 2Pe.02:04

that these angels were given a certain status or sphere of authority by God, but they were not
content with such a position."

saw her he said, "Ahh! Finally! Someone like me!"

everything, when the woman had a conversation with the snake which was the craftiest

\old And she answered, "Of course we may eat it. It's only the fruit from the tree at the center of the garden that we
are not allowed to eat. God says we must not eat it or even touch it, or we will die."
\bt And the woman said, "No of course not, we can eat from any of the trees that we like,
except for the tree in the center of the garden which is the tree of the knowledge of good
and bad cuz God says if we eat from that tree then we'll die."

everything, both good and evil."

you'll become just like Him, knowing everything, both good and bad.

\old Well, the woman was convinced. The fruit looked so fresh and delicious, and it would make her so wise! So she
ate some of the fruit. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her. Then he ate it, too.
\bt Well the woman was convinced, and she looked and at the tree and saw the fruit and
saw that it look good and looked really tasty to eat. So she took some of that fruit and
she ate it. And she gave some to the man who was also there with her.

leaves together to cover themselves.

husband will be your master, even though you wish that you could be in charge."

\ln 02.19
\old And to Adam he said, "Because you disobeyed [KT: disobey] me, and listened to your wife and ate the fruit I
told you not to eat, I have placed a curse on the ground. All your life you will struggle to scratch a living from it.
\bt And then God said to Adam "Because you've done this evil thing and eaten from the tree

you came. For you were made from dirt, and to the dirt you will return." And that was Adam's punishment for
disobeying God.

die,"

\co Animist Set
\co Redemptive Theme:  Continues the theme of "Victor", at this point showing God as more powerul than
evil spirits / other gods.  Shows evil spirits attempting to thwart God and lead people astray.
\co Basic biblical concepts: God as powerful, almighty (more powerful than any other god or spirit); God
requiring obedience to him and disobedience / worshipping false god considered as evil / sin.
\co Selection issues:  Depending on the context and the worldview issues involved a different story may be
used here, e.g. Balaam as shaman (Num 22, 23:1-8,19-26, 25:1-9, 31:1-3,7-9,15-16); or Job excerpts;

\t ZECHARIAH 
\ver DP, 21Nov08 (shortened)
\co Animist Set
\co Redemptive Theme:  Continues to develop the theme of Victory over Satan -- in this story naming Satan. 
Shows a need for someone (priest) to make things right between people and God.  
\co Selection issues:  Like many of the other prophet "stories", this is a composite story, that is, necessarily
a selection of passages that will be most relevant to the fulfillments seen in the Gospel stories.
\co Cohesion:  Continues the "meaning of names" sub-theme.  In this story it is the meaning of the priest
Jeshua's name, foreshadowing that of Jesus.

\bt So God raised up different spokesmen to deliver his messages to his people. One of
them was the spokesman Zechariah, who delivered messages from God to the people of
Jerusalem, the capital city of his nation.

\bt One of the messages of Zechariah was this, he said: "This message is straight from God,
God says  ---Shout and be glad, for a day is coming when I will live among you. ---Many
nations will join themselves to the me on that day, and they, too, will be my people.

\bt Later on, Zechariah had a vision that took place in heaven. 
\anc Zec.03:01 
\cn Heaven -- (from Translator's Handbook) The Hebrew does not state an exact location for this
scene. Some commentators understand this to be simply heaven (Mason); others think in more
detail of a heavenly court (Baldwin, R. L. Smith, Meyers & Meyers, Stuhlmueller [KT: 1988],
Merrill) or even the gate of heaven (BJ and JB/ NJB in footnotes).

\bt In this vision he saw Jeshua, the High Priest where Zechariah was. In their language
Jeshua's name sounded like the word for "Save" or "Rescue". His job as priest was to
make things right between the people and God.

clothes and give him fine new clothes.
