\t STRONG MAN
\ver JP (need to record)
\co Animist Set
\co Redemptive Theme:  Uses the brief parable of the "Strong man" to illustrate the redemptive theme of
Jesus coming to earth to defeat the power of Satan.  
\co Purpose:   Uses the context of Jesus casting out a demon to set up the conflict between the religious
leaders and Jesus, and the religious leaders wanting to get rid of Jesus.  
\ln 08.01
\bt One day Jesus was with a crowd of people, and there was a demon possessed man
there. He was mute -- the demon made it so that he couldn't speak.  Well, Jesus
commanded the demon to come out and the man started to talk!  
\anc Luk.11:14, Mat.12:22
\ln 08.02
\bt The crowd was amazed, and said "Could he be the One God promised to send?" 
\anc Mat.12:23
\ln 08.03
\bt But the religious leaders who were there, said, "Ha! it's no wonder he can cast out
demons. He gets his power from the RULER of demons!"
\anc Luk.11:15 
\anc Mat.12:22 (religious leaders)
\ln 08.04
\bt Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he gave them several illustrations to show that
that was a ridiculous accusation. Some of the illustrations were these:
\anc Luk.11:17 
\anc Mat.12:25 (ridiculous charge) Deibler's Index of implicit information <<to show them that to say he was casting
out evil spirits by Satan's power was a ridiculous charge, he said to them, … [communicator intent and/or
explication of metaphor]>>
\ln 08.05
\bt He said, "A kingdom which makes war against itself, can't win!  And if Satan fights
against himself, his kingdom is doomed."
\anc Luk.11:18
\ln 08.06
\bt And then he said, "Think about a strong man. When a strong man guards his own house,
and he's got his weapons ready, then all his posessions are safe. 
\anc Luk.11:21 
\ln 08.06
\bt But when a stronger man comes along, he can attack him and overpower him. He strips
him of all the weapons he was depending on, and carries off his posessions and gives
them to his companions.
\anc Luk.11.22 
\ln 08.07
\co MEANING (but don't make explcit): So you see, I cast out Satan's demons because I am stronger than
Satan.
\anc Luk.11.22 Translator's Notes <<11:22d (Implied:) In the same way, I have defeated Satan, and that is why I
am able to make his evil spirits leave people.)
\anc Luk.11.22 Deibler's Index of implicit information <<Similarly my casting out evil spirits proves my power is
greater than Satan's [explication of metaphor]>>
\ln 08.08
\bt There's no middle ground. Either you're with me or you're against me.
\anc Luk.11.23
\ln 08.09
\bt If you're not helping me gather, you're actually scattering!"
\anc Luk.11:23
