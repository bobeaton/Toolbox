\co Animist Set
\co Purpose:  This twelve-story panorama is an exploratory panorama used in training in the OneStory
partnership. It provides one sample of a short panorama that OneStory suggests be used as a discovery
tool -- a way of exploring worldview and socio-cultural issues with mother-tongue story crafters, starting
with a set of stories that the OneStory team may consider from an initial exposure to the people group to
be a useful starting point.  A completely different exploratory panorama would be constructed where the
broad worldview is e.g. Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Secular / Agnostic, or other broad worldview types. 
Even within these types, an initial panorama of this nature can be a uniquely designed tool that takes
advantage of what the OneStory team discovers in an initial discovery period of considering the unique
worldview and socio-cultural context of each people group.  So, for example, instead of the Elijah story
used here, this may be useful among an animist group where animal sacrifice is a part of the culture or
tradition, but in cases where sacrifice is unknown or abhorrent to a people group, it may be more helpful
for this initial exploratory set to use a story like Balaam, as an example of a shaman who experiences
God's over-ruling power; or Job as a priest making offerings for his family, and caught in the conflict of
Satan and God, or the Witch of Endor story, if consulting someone from the world of the dead is a known
concept
\co Selection issues:  This Creation story begins with the concept of where spirit beings in the world come
from.  In many animist contexts, and particularly where spirits are thought to be the souls of people who
have died, it may be helpful to have an initial composite story (or story section) that gives an alternate
(and biblical) view of where the spirit beings (both good and evil / angels and demons) come from.  The
short version given in lines 01-07 below is considered to be non-controversial (1) in avoiding reference to
the Isaiah 14 and Ezequiel 28 passages that some, but not most, exegetes think to be referring to Satan;
and (2) in avoiding the placement of the fall of the angels in a particular point in time (i.e. before the
creation of the world, versus after it, etc.).
\co Selection issues:  The part of this creation story that deals with the creation of the world and of people
uses the Genesis 2 account.  This is primarily done because the Genesis 2 account is more narrative and
memorable (less of a "list") than the Genesis 1 account. 
\co Redemptive Theme:  The primary redemptive theme use in this story set is that of Jesus as victor over
the spirit world, and particularly over the master of the evil spirits, Satan.  The redemptive theme shows
people calling on Jesus as the one having the power to rescue them from the darkness and death they
find themselves bound in.  This creation story introduces this theme by giviing the origins of the spirit
world as being created by God, but rebelling against him.
\co Basic biblical concepts:  God as creater of all things, physical and spiritual.  Rebellion against God (sin) as
something he doesn't tolerate, and that will be punished.
\co Cohesion:  This story introduces the instruction from God not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, as background for the next story "Fall".
\co Cohesion:  In this story there is the beginning of a "meaning of names" sub-theme.  Here in this story it
is the meaning of Adam's name.
\ln 01.01
\bt This is the true story that starts at the begining of time. We know about these things,
even way back then, because God told people about them long ago through his
spokesmen.
\anc Introductory remarks: 2Ti.03:16 
\anc Psa.119:142 (New Century Version) "...your teachings are true"; Psa.119:160 (NIV) "all your words are true";
Jhn.17:17 "your word is true"
\ln 01.02
\bt In the very beginning, before anything else existed, there was God. He has always
existed. 
\anc Jhn.01:01 -2, 1Ti.01:17
\ln 01.03
\bt He created spirit beings [KT: angel]  to be his messengers.
\anc Psa.148:02, Psa.148:05
\cn NOTE: "to be his messengers" is based on the meaning of key term.  See Key Biblical Terms document in TW
(Translator's Workplace), where the first suggested phrase for translating "angel" is given as "messenger
of/from God".
\ln 01.04
\bt These spirit beings praised God and carried out his commands.
\anc Psa.103:20 -21
\ln 01.05
\bt They sang for joy as God created the earth, as he measured and structured it to make it
exactly the way that he wanted it.
\anc Job.38:04 -7
\ln 01.06
\bt At some point, some of these spirit beings [KT: angel] turned to evil. They weren't
happy with the positions that God had given them. And so they turned against God and
all the good that he had given them, and disobeyed [KT: disobey].
\anc Jud.01:06; Jas.02:19, 2Pe.02:04
\cn NOTE: see Translator's Handbook Jud.01:06 "they aspired to a higher status. The verse is saying that these
angels were given a certain status or sphere of authority by God, but they were not content with such a
position."
\ln 01.07a
\bt These disobedient spirits [KT: disobey] became the evil spirits we know of now --
demons [KT: demon].  And one of them is the ruler of the rest. 
\anc 2Pe.02:04, Mat.25:41, Mat.09:34
\ln 01.07b
\bt These evil spirits continue to work against what God is doing here on earth, and against
those who follow God’s ways.  
\anc Eph.06:11 -12
\ln 01.07c 
\bt God pronounced a judgment on them all.  He said that they would someday be punished
in an everlasting fire.
\anc Mat.25:41
\ln 01.08
\bt But back to the earth that God had created -- when God made the earth, at first there
was no vegetation.
\anc Gen.02:04 -5
\ln 01.09
\bt And there was no one there to farm the ground.
\anc Gen.02:05
\ln 01.10
\bt And so God created the plants and the trees and the grass. And he created the fish and
the birds and the animals.
\anc Gen.01:11- 12, Gen.01:20- 21, Gen.01:24- 25
\ln 01.11
\bt And then God created humans. 
\anc Gen.02:07, Gen.01:27
\ln 01.12
\bt He took some dirt from the ground and formed it into the shape of a man, and then
phuuuuu, he breathed life into it, and it became a living breathing human being.
\anc Gen.02:07
\ln 01.13
\bt Now God had also made an orchard--a beautiful place with rivers and trees -- beautiful
trees that produced delicious fruit.
\anc Gen.02:08 -9; 
\anc Gen.02:10 -14 (rivers) 
\cn The names of the rivers and this section in general is omitted because of the difficulty of introducing several
new names in an oral story that is meant to be learned and spread by those initially unfamiliar with it.
\ln 01.14
\bt At the center of the orchard  he placed two special trees - the tree that gives life and
the tree that gives knowledge of good and evil.
\anc Gen.02:09
\ln 01.15
\bt God put the man in the orchard to take care of it.
\anc Gen.02:15
\ln 01.16
\bt But he gave him this warning. He said: "You are free to eat any fruit in the garden
EXCEPT the fruit from the tree that gives knowledge of good and evil. If you eat fruit
from that tree, you'll die.
\anc Gen.02:16 -17
\ln 01.17
\bt And God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I'll make a companion for him." 
\anc Gen.02:18
\ln 01.18
\bt Now all of the animals that God had made, he brought to the man to see what he would
name them; and whatever the man called each of them, that was its name.  (The man's
own name came to be known as Adam, since the word for "man" in the language of the
ones who first told this story sounded like Adam.)
\anc Gen.02:19
\cn Names and their meanings is a minor cohesive thread throughout the stories, beginning here. The comment
about Adam's name justifies the switch in many translations from referring to the same word first as "the man"
and then "Adam".
\ln 01.19
\bt So Adam named the domestic animals, birds, wild animals, everything. But none of
them was a suitable companion for him.
\anc Gen.02:20
\ln 01.20
\bt So then God put Adam into a deep sleep, and he opened up his side and took out a rib,
and closed him back up.
\anc Gen.02:21
\ln 01.21
\bt And from the rib he made a woman. He brought the woman to Adam, and he said, "Ahh!
This one is like me!"
\anc Gen.02:22 -23 
\cn 23b through 24 are omitted since they are poetic and thus difficult to express in the flow of an oral story. 
\ln 01.22
\bt Now the man and woman were not wearing any clothes, but they didn't feel any shame.

\t FALL 
\sound C:/OneStoryProjects/Animist/Animist 02--Fall.mp3
\co Animist Set
\co Redemptive Theme:  This story shows the master of the demons, in the form of a snake, deceiving the
woman and cause her and the man to disobey, bringing about their own state of curse and suffering, and
need of redemption.
\co Basic biblical concepts: Sin as disobedience to God's instructions.  
\co Cohesion:  Continues the "meaning of names" sub-theme.  Here in this story it is the meaning of Eve's
name, and even Adam giving the animals names.
\ln 02.01
\bt So Adam and his wife, were living in the garden that God had made for them. And their
job was to cultivate it and take care of it. 
\anc Gen.02:15
\ln 02.02
\bt And they spent their evenings being in God's presence when he would walk there in the
cool part of the day. 
\anc Gen.03:08 (rechronologized) 
\cn Hamilton Commentary on Genesis in TW says "The verb used here to describe the divine movement...suggests
iterative and habitual aspects. Such walks would take place in the early evening.
\ln 02.05
\bt But then one day something happened that changed everything. A snake, the most
sneaky of all the animals God had made, had a conversation with the woman. He said to
her. "Did God really say you must not eat any of the fruit in the garden?"
\anc Gen.03:01
\ln 02.06
\bt And she answered, "Of course we may eat it. It's only the fruit from the tree at the
center of the garden that we are not allowed to eat. God says we must not eat it or even
touch it, or we will die."
\anc Gen.03:02, 3
\ln 02.07
\bt "You won't die!" the snake hissed. "God knows that when you eat it you will become
just like him, knowing everything, both good and evil."
\anc Gen.03:04, 5
\ln 02.08
\bt Well, the woman was convinced. The fruit looked so fresh and delicious, and it would
make her so wise! So she ate some of the fruit. She also gave some to her husband,
who was with her. Then he ate it, too.
\anc Gen.03:06
\ln 02.09
\bt And all of a sudden, something changed in them, and they felt shame at their
nakedness. So they strung big fig leaves together to cover themselves.
\anc Gen.03:07
\ln 02.10
\bt Toward evening they heard God walking in the garden, so they hid themselves among
the trees.
\anc Gen.03:08
\ln 02.11
\bt God called to Adam, "Where are you?"
\anc Gen.03:09
\ln 02.12
\bt Adam answered, "I heard you, so I hid. I was afraid because I was naked."
\anc Gen.03:10
\ln 02.13
\bt And God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten the fruit I
commanded you not to eat?"
\anc Gen.03:11
\ln 02.14
\bt And Adam said, "The woman you gave me handed me the fruit, and I ate it."
\anc Gen.03:12
\ln 02.15
\bt Then God asked the woman, "How could you do such a thing?"  And she replied, "The
snake tricked me. That's why I ate it."
\anc Gen.03:13
\ln 02.16
\bt So God said to the snake, "Because you have done this, you will be punished. You will
grovel in the dirt as long as you live, crawling along on your belly.
\anc Gen.03:14
\ln 02.17
\bt From now on, you and the woman will be enemies, and your offspring and hers will be
enemies. You will strike his heel, but he will crush your head."
\anc Gen.03:15
\ln 02.18
\bt Then he said to the woman, "You will give birth to your children with intense pain and
suffering. And from now on your husband will be your master, even though you'll wish
you were in charge."
\anc Gen.03:16
\ln 02.19
\bt And to Adam he said, "Because you disobeyed [KT: disobey] me, and listened to your
wife and ate the fruit I told you not to eat, I have placed a curse on the ground. All your
life you will struggle to scratch a living from it.
\anc Gen.03:17
\ln 02.20
\bt It will grow thorns and thistles for you.
\anc Gen.03:18
\ln 02.21
\bt All your life you will sweat to produce food, until your dying day. Then you will return to
the ground from which you came. For you were made from dirt, and to the dirt you will
return." And that was Adam's punishment for disobeying God.
\anc Gen.03:19
\ln 02.22
\bt Adam named his wife Eve, which means "living", because she would become the
mother of all living human beings everywhere.
\anc Gen.03:20
\ln 02.25
\bt And then God made clothes for Adam and Eve from animal skins.
\anc Gen.03:21
\ln 02.26
\bt And he said, "The man and woman have become like me, knowing both good and evil. I
can't let them eat the fruit of the Tree that gives Life because then they will live
forever!"
\anc Gen.03:22
\ln 02.27
\bt So the LORD God banished Adam and his wife from the garden.
\anc Gen.03:23
\ln 02.28
\bt And he stationed powerful spirit beings, and a flaming sword flashing back and forth,
guarding the way to the Tree that gives Life.
