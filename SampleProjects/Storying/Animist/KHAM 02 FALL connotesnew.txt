for this story!

\fac JK1 - Is it o.k. to say their spirit and body?
\con EW1- TW Handbook Gen 3:22 says: "And live for ever refers to
future time, a time that never ends, unlimited duration. There is
no attempt here to distinguish between physical and spiritual
living... Two examples of the way the last half of this verse has
been rendered are: ``We can't let him go near this Tree of Life.
He must not eat the fruit of this tree too and live forever''; and
``We must not let him eat the fruit of this tree that gives life. If
he eats this fruit, he will never die.'' - I am not sure it would be
good to say both spirit and body.  You should try and test the
story first WITHOUT specifying "spirit and body."  If people are
confused, for example, thinking that the death referred to was
purely physical or purely spiritual, that would be evidence that
you could try to be more specific about "body and spirit."

\con EW1- This is not exactly a part of the Fall story.  And the anchor
you have here is about Satan, not relationship between God and
people, or the body growing old.  Want to try and avoid having
'teaching points' in the stories if possible.  You could add to line
2.06 - "they would certainly die, on that same day, for sure, they
would die..." or somehow emphasize the death part.
\ln 02.08
\fac JK1- No anchor, but seems to be good for the audience to
understand. Is this acceptable?
\con EW1- Better to let people come to this conclusion on their own.  
This line is a little bit of adding a "preaching/teaching point" in
the middle of the story...See also note on next line (2.09)- this
gives us information about how we can describe the snake- and
we really should avoid connecting it to Satan here if possible.
\ln 02.09
\con EW1- TR Notes on Gen 3:1 says, "The serpent is explicitly
identified elsewhere in Scripture as Satan (Revelation 12:9,
20:2) but is not so identified in Genesis. You should not therefore
explicitly refer to Satan here."  TR Handbook says, "Serpent,
which translates the usual word for ``snake,'' has had a long
history of interpretation. Some commentators have held that the
serpent refers to Satan in disguise. Others have taken the
position that it is a symbol for curiosity...."  There are a few
more notes you can look at.  For now, you should try testing the
story with JUST saying it was a snake and see if people make the
connection.  If not, then it would be okay to say that Satan came
in the form of a snake.  This has been done for another project.

\con EW1- Better to leave out "the enemy" here- see if listeners get
this idea from listening to the story without explicitly stating it.  If
you use snake earlier in the story, you can again say snake
here.
\ln 02.27
\con EW1- At first I found, TR NOTES ON GEN. 2:15 - "If possible, use
the same verb in 3:15c and 3:15d. The translation “crush” (TEV,
NIV), in 3:15c, seems to be influenced by the interpretation that
this refers, prophetically, to Christ’s ultimate defeat of Satan.
This should be avoided because prophecy should never be
translated in a way more specific than the original text."
\con EW1- As mentioned above, if the connection with Satan isn't
understood by the listeners, then it can be made a bit more
explicit. However, since part of the curse is that the snake will
crawl on his belly, I don't think we would be justified in saying
that the curse was JUST to Satan.  This line should be adjusted.

\fac JK1- No anchor, but add this for the Buddhist understands all
living being never die in "the cycle of life" Is it acceptable?
\con EW1- Generally, we can't add direct speech.  In other words, we
can put words into people's mouths- especially God's :)  This is a
separate thought and so would not be able to be explicitly
anchored.  A sentence from the narrator AFTER God concludes
might be okay, something like, "And so it happened, and
happens even today..." - you would need to anchor it with the
death of Adam, maybe a few others, and then also your cultural
note."  However, I think this would disrupt the chronology- to say
"it happened" indicating his death and then go back and mention
him being put out of the garden...So...may be best to re-think
this line/concept.  This may be a concept that can become clear
in later stories with other people dying and not coming back. 
May be something to make explicit with some of the characters
in your stories.
