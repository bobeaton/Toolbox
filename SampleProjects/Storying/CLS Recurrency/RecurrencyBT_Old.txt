\bt Jesus nasceu assim.
\eng Jesus was born like this.
\anc Mat.01:18
\cn

\ln 100.02
\bt Maria estava com Jos√©. Ela se viu gravida do √âspirito Santo.
\eng Mary was with Joseph. She became pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
\anc Mat.01:18

\ln 100.03
\bt Jos√© sempre era um homem correto. 
\eng Joseph was always a right man.
\anc Mat.01:19
\cn This sentence would be better to come after the fact that Joseph wanted to
abandon her. Just seems cut and pasted here. will revise.

\ln 100.04
\bt Jos√© no mesmo momento queria abandonar a Maria mas e um anjo veio em sonho
e disse, "Jos√©, filho de Dav√≠, ele n√£o tinha medo de abandonar a Maria. O filho
que ela est√° esperando √© do √àspirito Santo e ela dar a luz e voc√™s v√£o dar a
nome de Deus a ele. Ele vai salvar as pessoas dos pecados."
\eng Joseph, at that same moment, wanted to leave Mary but an angel came in
a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, he didn't have any fear of leaving
Mary. The child that she is waiting for is from the Holy Spirit and she will
give birth and you (ya'll) will give the name of God to him. He will save the
people from sins."
\anc Mat.01:20
\cn See L&C Notes: √âspirito Santo.
\cn
\fix Obviously there is a problem in Angels delcaration to Joseph as it switches to
past tense. We will correct this in the future. Also, he said that Joseph was not
afraid of abandoning Mary which is not true to the story.

\ln 100.05
\bt Jos√© casou com Maria e deu o nome de Deus a Ele. Jos√© n√£o teve rela√ß√µes com
Maria antes que Jesus nasceu.
\eng Joseph married Mary and gave the name of God to Him. Joseph didn't
have relations with Mary before Jesus was born.
\anc Mat.01:24-25

\ln 100.06
\bt Jesus nasceu na cidade de Beleem.
\eng Jesus was born in the city of Bethlehem
\anc Mat.02:01

\ln 100.07
\bt Um pouco alguns homems estavam estudando as estrelhas. 
\eng After a little bit som men were studying the stars.
\anc Mat.02:01, 02

\ln 100.08
\bt Ele vem do Oriente em Jerusalem e perguntarem a onde que ¬¥ta o menino. Nos
viemos a estrela e viemos para ver ele.
\eng they came from the East in Jerusalem and asked where is the boy. We
saw the stars and came to see him.
\anc Mat.02:02

\ln 100.09
\bt Herodes viu isto da√≠ ficou muito preocupado. 
\eng Herod saw this  and from there became very concerned.
\anc Mat.02:03

\ln 100.10
\bt N√≥s vimos a estrela e gostamos dela.
\eng We saw a star and we liked it.
\anc Mat.02:02
\cn
\fix Clearly this needs to be corrected in regard to why the visitors from the East
came. They came to worship/adore him and not simply to ¥like¥ him.

\ln 100.11
\bt E da√≠ Herodes fiz os l√≠deres da religi√£o e pediu a onde que nasceu este Rei dos
Judeus?
\eng And from there Herod made the leaders of the religion and asked where
this King of the Jews was born?
\anc Mat.02:04
\cn Unclear... no mention of meeting that Herod demanded.

\ln 100.12
\bt Da√≠ responderam, "Na cidade de Beleem. Eles ganharem um profeta "
\eng From there they responded, "In the city of Bethlehem. They have recieved
a prophet"
\anc Mat.02:05
\fix No mention of the prophets who announced this. Seems the man thought the
religious leaders were stating this of their own accord (no Scriptural backing).
It is confusing as it is and will be corrected.

\ln 100.13
\bt E da√≠, Herodes urgentemente se reuniu com aqueles que vierem. Da√≠ ele pediu
quando que a estela veio? Da√≠ eles falarem.
\eng And from there, Herod met ungently with those who came. From there he
asked when the star appeared? From there they said.
\anc Mat.02:07
\cn Needs to note that the meeting was in SECRET. Points to his underhandedness.

\ln 100.14
\bt Ele mandou eles para Beleem. "V√£o pedir a onde que esta este menino. Da√≠ voc√™s
voltam para que eu posso gostar dele."
\eng He sent them to Bethlehem. "Go ask where this boy is. From there you
(ya'll) return so that I can like (enjoy) him."
\anc Mat.02:08
\cn Needs some attention to how they will find out where Jesus is. 
\fix Also, Herod said that he wanted to worship/adore. I need to find out if they
have a work for adore, worship which is more than ¥like¥ as it keeps recurring.
Perhaps this is a word not known or it is intentional as worship of Mary is
intense...Will field test.. (He was consistent with this word throughout...perhaps
there is no other word...needs to be tested.

\ln 100.15
\bt No caminho eles viram de novo a estrela dele. Da√≠ at√© l√° na casa onde que ¬¥tava
o menino e eles gostavam dele.
\eng On the path they again saw his star. From there to beyond there where
the house where the boy was and they like him.
\anc
\cn
\fix Noted above...came to worship/adore. Here he uses the past tense ¥they liked
him.¥

\ln 100.16
\bt Com muito alegre eles entrarem dentro da casa e se ajoelharem em frente dele e
gostarem dele.
\eng With much joy they went inside the house and knelt in front of him and
liked him.
\anc
\cn
\fix again ¥liked¥ him, no mention of worship. Consitently used this word throughout
the story.

\ln 100.17
\bt Da√≠, eles derem presentes de ouro. 
\eng And then, they gave presents of gold.
\anc
\cn
\fix Offered more than just gold. Will be corrected.

\ln 100.18
\bt Deus aviso que n√£o era para vim de volta porque Herodes estava esperando eles.
\eng God advised that it wouldn't do to return because Herod was waiting for
them.
\anc Mat.02:12
\cn Not clear who God advised. 

\ln 100.19
\bt Quando Jos√© estava dormindo um anjo do c√©u veio e o anjo disse, "Foge com o
menino. Foge para o Eg√≠to porque Herodes quer matar ele." Jos√© obedeceu.
\eng When Joseph was sleeping and angel of heaven came and the angel says,
"Flee with the boy. Flee to Egypt because Herod wants to kill him." Joseph
obeyed.
\anc Mat.02:13, 14
\cn Needs a transition phrase here such as...a little time later...afterwards....

\ln 100.20
\bt Herodes viu que era enganado. Da√≠ ele avisou que era para matar todo menor a
baixo de dois anos em Beleem.
\eng Herod saw that he was tricked. Then he advised that it should be done
that everyone under two years in Bethleham should be killed.
\anc Mat.02:16
\anc
\cn Needs to show in the story that Herods orders were carried out. 

\ln 100.21
\bt Quando Herodes morreu o anjo disse a Jos√©, "Pega a mai e o menino e vai para
Israel. "
\eng When Herod died an angel said to Joseph, "Get the mother and the boy
and go to Israel."
\anc Mat.02:19, 20

"Repent from your sins and baptize yourselves, everyone."

it is no problem.

\tst1 Q:Was hon te Yohan fer te Khaseire kesaat faa se mache? A: Nao combrar

\anc luk.03:12
\cn This word for tax gatherer needs to furthers researched. It was understood
fine. It is possible that the word for tax and tithe may be the same. If it is we
will just have to explain the different....give it context. Does shed some light
on the culture and how their Catholic worldview has developed. Honestly, in
Germany to this day the TITHE is a tax taken out of the workers wages and
distributed by the government to various acceptible churche (LUtheran,
Catholic, for ex). A forced tithe is a tax.

\ln 203.09
\bt E Jo√£o disse, ‚ÄúN√£o cobrem mais do que as leis mandam.‚Äù

‚ÄúN√£o tirem dinheiro de ninguem e n√£o denunciam nenhum inocente. Estejam
satisfeitos com os seu sal√°rio.‚Äù

take money from anyone and don't denounce anyone who is innocent.
Be satisfied with your salaries."

\anc luk.03:16
\cn I detected an inability to describe the Holy Spirit. This particular person is a
believer and she did did not want to give me a wrong answer so I had to probe
a bit. A story (ies) that cover the Holy Spirit will be important understanding

by what she did that she was a good person so he forgave her.
\cn Clearly we did not address the scope and breath of Jesus' authority to forgive
sins but for this one story it certainly highlighted repentance even though her
answer did not use this word it hit all alround it. What needs to be done is to
include stories as we go along showing the authority of Jesus Christ. Cures,
casting out demons, calming the storm will help. Also, stories where Jesus is
attributed to be more than a man by the demons that encounter him would also
help. I don't see one story solving this issue. However, I am very pleased that
the essence of repentance was understood.
