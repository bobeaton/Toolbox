\ln 79.01
\con BE1: It might good to ask the question here, "Why do you think children came to Isus and his students to touch
Him?" On this question, though, rtl2 seems to suggest that the inference is "to talk with him". So you should
probably revise this verse to include the purpose to make it clear (i.e. rather than "to touch Him" (which is
technically opposite of what was happening--they came to Him so that *He* would "touch" them), perhaps make
it "for Him to bless them" or "for Him to pray for the children".  (see next note).
\con BE1: You can add the following as a '\cn' note to the BT file: CONNOT (mrk.10:13): â€™Touch themâ€™ may need to
include the purpose â€˜to blessâ€™ to avoid a healing or commissioning purpose. â€˜Blessâ€™ might be rendered â€˜ask God to
bless/do good to them.â€™
\con BE1: in rtl2, "students... chase them away" sounds pretty natural. Does this seem more natural than "take them
away"?
\con BE1: It would also be good to ask, "Why do you think Isus students take them away?" (or "chase them away" if
you revise it)--to get at the inferred motive of their action.
\con BE1: Technically, it was people (probably parents) who were bringing their children to Jesus for Him to bless
them (the children). Both of the retellings suggests that the UNSs interpreted this to be that the children seem
to have come on their own. This is probably a small thing, but it does impinge on the issue of "accuracy". If you
want to avoid a complex sentence, you could even make it simply passive (i.e. "children were brought to
Jesus...") so that the right inference is made and yet it hids the identity of the agents.
\ln 79.02
\con BE1: both retellings seem to have left out the "God's kingdom is for such". If you feel this is necessary given
your purpose for the story or for the sake of "coverage", you'll need to try to say it so that it is made more
prominent (e.g. you might try o reverse the two parts: (reason) "God's kingdom is for/of such". Therefore,
(command) "leave them with me"). You should try to look in your non-biblical story database to see if you can
figure out the normal order of these two. That is, either "reason... (therefore) command" or "command
(because) reason".
\ln 79.03
\con BE1  Oh... I see that in rtl2 the UNS gave the equivalent of "God's kingdom is for such" *after* 79.03. By the
way, the way to indicate this would be to put "[after 79.03]" at the end of the rtl2 in 79.02. This tells the
consultant that the portion that was expected here was said later. Similarly, for rtl1 in 79.02 you have "he has
blessed them" which is actually from 79.04. So you could put "[in 79.02]" for rtl1 in 79.04.
\con BE1: You have an accuracy issue here (as you point out in the '\co' note in the BT file). The retellers have
incorrectly understood that Jesus is saying that one needs to "accept God's kingdom" at a young age. Frankly,
this is a very difficult passage to translate (or craft) in an understandable way. I'm wondering out loud
whether you ought to even have this part of the story in this story. That is, perhaps it would be better if this
story were just the Rich Young Ruler part. Then if you wanted to have another story on how Jesus feels about
children and/or "the meek and mild" (which might be a better way of expressing what Jesus is getting at here...
or "child-like faith"...), you might make that a separate story, where you could unpack that more properly
without trying to put both things in one story (see CONNOT and TN on mrk.10:15 in TW for some good
suggestions). In any case, the reteller's phrase "it become difficult later" is exactly the opposite of what we
want people to think :-)  [before you process this note, however, see my equivocation in 79.11]
\ln 79.04
\con BE1: TRT suggests "prayed for them" if 'blessing' has little meaning (as suggested by ER's response).
\ln 79.05
\con BE1: It would good to look at your database of natural stories to see what device is used to transition from one
episode to another (c.f. English, "Now...") That would go nicely at the beginning of this verse. It might even be
something like, "Some time later..." (OR better yet, look at the retellings, which seem to have something
equivalent)
\con BE1: Both of the retellings seem very nice and natural here. Is there something in these that might go nicely in
the original story (e.g. "sweet teacher", "he wants to be alive forever", "reach life")?
\ln 79.06
\con BE1: rtl2 sounds very nice! Is there something in that that you might put into the original story?
\con BE1: on the other hand rtl1 has left out this "who is good by God" part entirely. If you follow my suggestion in
79.11, then this part won't be crucial to the theme/purpose of this story and perhaps you could leave these few
verses out as well.
\con BE1: the answer to your 2nd question by "ER" seems mis-interpreted (it's true that "only God can do that", but
that's not what this verse is about). However, since RC seems to have given a good answer, it may be okay.
Perhaps if you explain to ER what it really means (after the test, of course) and ask him how to say it so that it
would be more clear, (s)he might have a good suggestion.
\ln 79.07
\con BE1: Interesting answers to your question here... since they disbelieve in an afterlife, they probably also lack
a good idea of what it is (expected to be) like. Maybe you ought to have a story that tries to get at what eternal
life is like (e.g. the story of Lazarus, or one or more of Jesus parables on what the Kingdom of God is like). If
you do, it would go well *before* this one, so that once they have a better idea of what it's like and why one
might want to pursue going there, then this story can help show the proper "response attitude" for actually
getting there.
\ln 79.07.1
\con BE1: Discuss with the crafter(s) the difference between (story: "respect your mother and your father") and
(rtl2: "keep well with your mother and father"). Is the latter more natural?
\con BE1: it might be good to 'de-highlight' the keeping of the commandments as a way of gaining eternal life,
because it's likely to give the wrong impression. Perhaps something here like, "life will be inherited if you
obey God" (see TRT on mat.19:17) or "... obey God's orders", and then don't actally list them here (it's hard to
remember and brings too much focus on obeying of the commands).
\ln 79.08
\con BE1: rtl1's retelling here sounds like a nice way to short-cut this and the last several verses.
\ln 79.09
\con BE1: both retellings have left out the "Jesus liked him" part, which perhaps isn't crucial. However, it's likely
that the reason they left it out is because there's a contrast between the positive "he liked him" and the
negative "he lacks one thing", which isn't signaled in the story (at least according to the BT). Perhaps inserting
something like, "But nevertheless..." in between might help. See the CONNOT I added.
\con BE1: RC gave an excellent answer to your question here!
\ln 79.10
\con BE1: retellings suggest that this verse could be more succinct.
\ln 79.11
\con BE1: sorry to be fickle, but this verse makes me rethink my earlier suggestion, In your purpose statement at the
top, you imply two fairly distinct purposes for the different parts of this story (which could suggest that you
split it into two different stories). However, this verse points out that in one way these two stories have a
common theme: what kind of attitude one needs to have to get into God's kingdom: part a) like a child
following/obeying his father, and part b) not wrapped up in one's stuff... So if you were to re-write your
purpose statement and consider this a "what kind of attitude should we have to enter the KoG" story--and if
that fits an important part of your redemptive theme--then you could keep them both in this same story. Just be
sure that the common theme of both parts is seen as a single theme in the story thru testing.
\con BE1: rtl1 seems like a nice simplification of this verse (esp. when you see the bulky and inaccurate rtl2). i.e.
drop the "...to his students" part
\ln 79.12
\con BE1: you may have "acceptability" issues with this suggestion (i.e. church people might not approve), but it
sounds "sweet" to me if you were to turn the idiom into the local one (i.e. have something like, "Jesus explained
that it would be easier for a fly to turn into an elephant than for ..." (if you keep it in indirect speech, then it
might be less problematic for acceptability).
\con BE1: maybe I missed something earlier, but if the story says, "...to the Gods kingdom", then so should your
testing question (the 2nd of which says, "the sky's kingdom").
\con BE1: rtl1 has a nice succinct version of this too, which avoids the duplication of "rich people..." in 79.11 and
"rich..." in this verse... except for the change (s)he made from "to the God's kingdom" from "separate from his
riches".
\ln 79.13
\con BE1: it's interesting that both rtlrs said that it was "Peter" who said that rather than "student" But none of the
parallel passages say it was Peter... so I wonder where that came from? oh... I see now, it comes from
mrk.10:28.
\con BE1: compare (story: "who can be saved") vs. (rtl2: "who can come in the God’s kingdom").
\ln 79.14
\con BE1: rtl2's response is concerning. While (s)he did tie the two parts of this story into a single theme, he still is
mis-interpreting the first part's conclusion: it's not just for the young children, but rather for those who
trustingly obey God like children do their father/parents (again, see the exegetical helps for good suggestions
on how to render that first part). If we can get the first part interpreted correctly, then this might suggest that
people can see the common theme in both parts.
\ln 79.15
\ln 79.16
\ln 79.17
\con BE1: regarding your comment, "We might cut out the last bit seen as it is confusing." that seems like a good
idea and esp because this wouldn't necessarily fit the theme you're trying to build here (if you go with the
"what kind of attitude should we have to enter the KoG" theme).

\fac JW 3 - June 26, 2009

\bld NOTE: this consultation took place before we began using the checklist. Please add it and make
appropriate notes.

\con NP1: I like your thoroughness in the front part here. Very helpful. One other thing that would help is if you'll
tell what field marker each thing corresponds to. ie bt2 is of the 20apr revision or of the 10apr crafting. I'm
pretty sure it's the revision, but a month from now I will have forgotten that. 
\fac JW1 - Done
\ln 01.01
\con NP1: Don't forget to start a bio file for your bondo people too.
\fac JW1 - Started
\p
\con NP1: Why do you think there's the variation between bt and bt2 here and other places? It means that one of
the backtranslations wasn't literal. It looks like the lines were a bit too long, so that could be why they don't
match up well.  Can you read the bondo transcription well enough to see which one lines up better? For next
time you might have the BTers look at the transcription to check their backtranslation. 
\fac JW 1 - I'm not completely sure, but I would assume that there are a couple of factors in play.  One is probably
that this was their first time doing back translation like this.  Another is that Kawïre's Portuguese seems to be
at a higher level than Tomka's.  Also, their tendency was to want to take bigger chunks which I 'coached back'
with some success.  I don't really know which one lines up better.  Each seem to line up better than the other in
some places, but I infer this based on my knowledge of the sources that were used during the crafting session.
\p
\con NP1: In Bondo worldview does Imere have a body? ie is he just floating in the sky when he makes day and night
and then earth? Some testing questions like "why did imere want to fill the buraco?" might be good too. 
\fac JW 1 - I'm pretty sure Imere has a body, but I'll ask to be sure.  I've entered these testing questions for next
time.
\p
\con NP1: Whether you end up going with Imere, Deus, or Yawe you'll need to be deliberate about making sure the
story set as a whole covers the unbiblical views they have of him. I think you're probably right to not start off
with a monologue explaining who he is and all they believe that's wrong. Just make sure at some point in the
story set you cover the fact that he wasn't created and whatever else there is. 
\fac JW 1 - Do you think it's possible to do this if we're only able to complete 12-15 stories before our term ends? 
Do story sets sometimes start off with monologues?  These are just a couple of questions, but I understand
your note here.
\con NP2: I think you can cover the main stuff in 12-15 stories. The parents/being born thing definitely needs to be
covered. I have a few ideas about that, but tell me your thoughts first. What other barriers need to be hit in the
story set? Do they worship/respect Imere? Does he have authority over other spirits? Start your L&C entry
for this topic and spell this stuff out. Yes, unfortunately I've known of several story sets that start off with a
monlogue. A "what the Bible is" and a "who God is" story are both pretty popular and have no action and are
hard to remember. 
\fac JW 2 - I've made some notes but I dont really have any thoughts about the parents/being born stuff yet.
\con NP1: The first few lines of this story have God thinking or saying things that aren't directly anchorable from
scripture. Your dude is definitely an engaging storyteller, which is good, but you'll have to help him tame the
embelishment. The most you could have God saying in these lines is the command for things to exist -- "let there
be light".... "I want there to be day and night" .... "sun, exist" etc. Do you think the crafter didn't understand
those lines from Renato's story? Or did he just embelish?
\fac JW 1 - It didn't seem like he was misunderstanding here.  I'm guessing he was just 'going' with the story.  I'd
be interested to know if they 'embelish' their stories? 
\con NP2: I'd be curious too. How much is a storyteller free to add when telling one of the bondo heritage stories. 
\fac JW 2 - I'll ask some of them
\ln 01.02
\ln 01.03
\ln 01.04
\con NP1: Answering your question....I think everything in the line is OK except for the part where God talks.
\fac JW 1 - Ok 
\ln 01.05
\con NP1: Harkening back to my comment in line one about God's thoughts and speech, here the speech makes it
seem like God wakes up every morning and decides what he's going to create that day, which doesn't line up
with scripture. 
\fac JW 1 - I undestand
\ln 01.06
\con NP1: <fez floresta, como caipim, como cipo, imbe> -- One of the general rules for storycrafting is that you can
go more generic but you can't go more specific. So you can't name the specific animals that God made (lion,
bear, etc) or the ones that went on the ark. Same here, if the Bible doesn't give specific examples then we
can't either. 
\fac JW 1 - I realize how this ('going more specific') could become a slippery slope, however, you wouldn't have a
problem telling a Bondo person, "God made panthers", would you?  And you would/could say that based on
scripture, right?  I'm not sure I'm with you yet on this one.
\con NP2: You're probably in the majority, sadly for you the powerholders are the minority. I would have no problem
at all saying "God made panthers." And you're right, with simple deduction and assuming you're not an
evolutionist christian you could say it based on scripture. It comes down to: are you telling a Bible story or a
story based on the Bible. Now, in my mind Spirit World stories are pretty close to only being based on the Bible
if they aren't exactly that, so I don't know what to do with that. I'm happy to argue this (I love a good debate),
but I can tell you right now that we're not going to change Grant's or my dad's minds. This has been an issue
from the beginning and a lowly connotational consultant and his notebook toting team aren't going to change
their minds.
\fac JW 2 - You said, ''So you can't name the specific animals that God made (lion, bear, etc)'', but what if you use
the based on scripture/simple deduction coupled with a verse that simply references one of those specific
things (like a lion in a David story)?  And I'd like to see your dad and/or Grant explain how the Spirit World
stories aren't stories 'based on the Bible' as opposed to Bible stories. 
\con NP3: What they would say (and have said) is that it comes down to what's "necessary" for the group to
understand the stories. It's hard to argue that the panthers are necessary for them to understand the creation
story, much less the whole story set. But most people would accept that some form of a spirit world story is
necessary where the people's worldview on that subject is vastly different than the biblical one. It sounds a
little strange to say that you can break the rules if necessary, and that's what this seems like. But I think of it
more like we're weighing different options and trying to find the best. If you have to decide between a fully
anchorable story that they understand well and a somewhat questionably anchored story that they understand
well, you go with the first.....so no panthers. If you're deciding between a fully anchorable story that they
missunderstand completely and a somewhat questionably anchored story that they understand well (according to
how we interpret the meaning of scripture) (and assuming there's not a way to make it understandable and
anchorable), I go with the second....so spirit world stories are OK. It works the same way with specific
translation/cultural issues. For example, in the Philippian Jailer story, when the jailer sees that the doors to
the jail are open he assumes the prisoners have escaped so he gets out his sword to kill himself. The text
doesn't say "because he knew he  was going to be put to death for letting the prisoners escape". If hearers
missunderstand the story because the 'because....' line isn't there, then that's worse than making the story
slightly questionable in it's anchoring by adding the line. We're not about figuring out where the OK/not OK
line is and just getting on the OK side, that's the wrong system. We want to find the best way of communicating
the meaning that's as accurate to the text as possible. 
\fac JW 3 - Thanks for the more thorough explanation.  It was helpful.  God made panthers.

\con NP1: <animais aquaticas, aves aquaticas...jacaré, capivara> -- similar to line 6, this is going more specific than
scripture. Let them talk about this in the discussion time, it doesn't need to be in the story.

\con NP1: <ounça, anta, queixada> -- same as lines 6 & 10
\ln 01.13

(the animals)". 
\fac JW 1 - Got it.

\fac JW 1 - I would respond the same way I did in line 6
\ln 01.14
\ln 01.15
\con NP1: bt2 has this as a process...God blows, man moves, God blows again, man breathes, God blows again, man
gets up. bt doesn't have any of this. bt is anchorable, bt2 isn't. Which one reflects the actual story?
\fac JW 1 - Will check it out.
\ln 01.16
\con NP1: bt uses 'Yawé' here. But the bondo story has Imeré, right?
\fac JW 1 - The revised story only uses Imere.
\con NP1: This is probably my deficiency in Portuguese, but I can't tell from either backtranslation if it's saying
that God called the animals for Adam to name, or for God himself to name and the first thing he gave a name to
was Adam. Help me out. Testing would show this too. 
\fac JW 1 - The backtranslations aren't clear, but I'm sure you are deficient in Portuguese as well.  I've made a
note to do some testing.
\ln 01.17
\ln 01.18
\con NP1: Why is there English in bt?
\fac JW 1 - I think in both languages now.
\ln 01.19
\ln 01.20
\con NP1: You don't have an anchor for this line, I'm guessing because it's not fully anchorable. 
\fac JW 1 - Will take care of it.
\ln 01.21
\con NP1: Yeah, you'll need to fix this spirit-world-after-physical-world chronology issue. What are you thinking?
\fac JW 1 - Man, if I could establish plot without doing this whole spirit world stuff I would.  The whole thing still
just seems so shaky to me.  Any ideas?  Lozuk said they don't do 'spirit world' anymore.
\con NP2: I just looked at his connotes on a spirit world story for one of his own teams. So I don't think they're not
doing them anymore at all. It's hard to get away from practically, even though the conceptual issues keep
pushing you away. This is just off the top of my head right now, but what about doing a Creation story where
God creates the Spirits/angels before he makes the world, and you don't have any of them turning bad. Then
you do your regular storyset except at the first explicit instance of a demon or satan (I'm not counting the
snake) you say "now you remember those angels that God made, well some of them turned bad and the leader of
the bad ones was one called Satan......and he was in Zechariah's vision..." I really did like the way you did it in
your Portuguese story though, do you think the flashback is just not a storytelling device the bondo use?
\fac JW 2:  I'm not sure about the flashback thing in Bondo stories, but I'll work with this a little bit and see what
we come up with.
\con NP1: Wow, great testing here. This Oiope guy really opened up. I wonder if some stories that show that the
Israelites rejected Imere too would resonate, since he repeats several times that the other people didn't reject
him. 
\fac JW 1 - Good thought.
\con NP1: Did you do any testing of the Bondo word BTed as 'espiritus'? It will need thorough testing and also a L&C
enntry. 
\fac JW 1 - The word is 'wonkinom'.  I've started and L&C entry and added some testing.
\ln 01.22
\con NP1: I agree with the shadiness here. 
\fac JW 1 - Okay
\ln 01.23
\con NP1: bt2 uses 'bichos' while bt uses 'espiritos'. Is it different than the word for bicho above when God
creates animals? This is probably something worth explaining in the L&C entry. 
\fac JW 1 - Im on it.
\con NP1: Answering your anchor question -- the only thing I see wrong in bt2 is the 'mentindo' part. In bt I see <E o
nosso dono, Ele e nosso pai...nosso irmao> and <ele estava avisando os outros espiritos para eles nao
(10.46-10.47?)> as not anchorable.
\fac JW 1 - OK 
\ln 01.24
\con NP1: <"Voces nÃ£o me acredita, voces nÃ£o me obedece, voces nÃ£o ouve a minha palavra, voces nÃ£o ouve minha
opiniÃ£o...entÃ£o, agora voces vÃ£o tem que ter castigo.  Agora voces vai por lugar horrÃ­vel."> -- This could be
anchorable if the chronology is fixed. If you use mat.25.41 you'll need to put it in the future. 
\fac JW 1 - Ok
\ln 01.25
\con NP1: Yes, cold volcanos, not sure what to make of that, maybe in antarctica.
\fac JW 1 - Can we anchor with Wiki links?
\con NP2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_No_No
\ln 01.26
\con NP1: There are four recurring issues with this story, I've commented on some examples but probably not every
one. So you'll need to figure some of it out yourself. The four issues are: 1) the discrepancy between the two
backtranslations that probably means one or both aren't literal enough. 2) The ongoing 'thoughts/speech of
God' stuff that isn't fully anchorable. 3) The specific examples of things (animals, body parts, etc). 4) Not
enough testing in the middle part of the story. Can you write some more test questions and add them to the file
and send it to me? Then use those questions next time you test. The story is really very good for a first stab,
especially where there's no scripture. You should feel good about it.

\con NP2: Remember to make your own notes for stuff to test, research, or change based on  the retellings. You
don't need to wait for me to tell you what things to note. This reteller is amazing. He pretty much got the whole
thing. I'm impressed. 
\fac JW 2 - Yeah.  He pretty much just walks around our yard for about 15 minutes listening to the story through
headphones and then comes back and gets me and says, 'I'm ready to tell the story'
\ln 02.01
\con NP1: Similar to the creation story, for a list like this I would expect two backtranslations of the same story to
be very similar, where synonyms would be the maximum difference. One list shouldn't have twice as much on it
as another. In bt, 'aves aquaticos, animais aquaticos' isn't within the generic/specific rule. 
\fac JW 1 - One thought here.  I am not completely surprised that the backtranslations aren't as similar as you think
they would be due to the fact that the two backtranslators have different levels of Portuguese (in fact, it was
the first time ever out of the village for one of the guys...although we used him for backtranslation because we
didnt exactly have lots of options and he is part of the generation that has had Bondo and Portuguese spoken to
him since birth).  I will say though...this kind of discrepancy (especially in a list) is problematic. [Look at the
17th comment in the creation record...I think this may have led to them doing bigger chunks in the
backtranslation of the revised story than they did in the first one.]
\ln 02.02
\con NP1: <Adão preste muito atenção> (from bt2) -- there's nothing like this, that I can see, in bt. So there's something
wrong with the backtranslation process. 
\fac JW 1 - ok
\con NP2: Why do you think the reteller had God only giving the "don't eat" command to Eve?
\fac JW 2 - I dont really know.  Ive made a note to ask
\ln 02.03
\con NP1: Yeah, 'eva estava sentada' isn't anchorable. Interesting that it's 'eva estava no mato' in bt2. Do you think
the first guy heard wrong?
\fac JW 1 - Maybe.  The next time someone comes through town, I'll have them do 'fresh ear' backtranslations on
these first three stories to see what we come up with...
\ln 02.04
\con NP1: Good testing here. I would have asked a follow up question like, "porque a cobra queria matar eles?" At
some point we hope they'll figure out who the snake really is. It's probably a bit early in the set and/or early in
the storying process now, but keep testing for it. 
\fac JW 1 - I put it in for next time...
\con NP2: Interesting that the reteller added <A cobra era esperta e inteligente, controlava muitas coisas.> Even
though there wasn't anything like that in the crafted story (unless it was in the original and not in the revision).
Do you think that's just his impression from the story.....and it goes along with our other conversation about the
snake maybe being the hero? Or did he know 'crafty' from somewhere and this what they way he put it. 
\fac JW 2 - Actually I think this is connected to one of their stories.  Tomka retold this story and he was also the
one to tell me the traditional 'ogoy' (snake) story.  My guess is that these are characteristics of the snake in
their story?
\con NP3: That's cool. Do you have a translation of that story that you could send me? Most people put them in
toolbox records.
\fac JW 3 - For now I sent an audio file of a backtranslation of the Ogoy story as well as an audio file of an
'interview' i did with Tomka about this story
\con NP2: Are fruit measured in feet in brazil? What is 'pÃ©' about?
\fac JW 2 - No.  That's what they call fruit trees here...pÃ© de caju, pÃ© de manga, etc...
\ln 02.05
\con NP1: <vocês vão ver o futuro que vai acontecer > (bt2) -- I don't see this as anchorable. It might be true, but it's
not explicit enough in the text. Interesting that it's not in bt....unless it's the 3.38 part. 
\fac JW 1 - I put in a note
\con NP2: What does <voces vao ficar que nem Ele> mean in the retelling?  
\fac JW 2 - que nem means 'just like'...so he was saying 'if you guys eat you'll become just like Ele... so that you
wont become just like Him, He's not letting you eat'
\ln 02.06
\ln 02.07
\con NP1: <ofereceu Adão (seu marido)> -- if the parentheses is something that's actually in the bondo story then take
it out of parentheses and use comas or something. If it's the backtranslator clarifying something, then can you
label it as such.
\fac JW 1 - Its in the Bondo story...I took it out of parenthesis
\con NP2: The retell says <e eles sentiram vergonha um do outro>, I thought about commenting on <eles sentiram
verhonha deles> in the crafted story but decided it was OK. I couldn't decide if they were ashamed in front of
each other or in front of God. Paste this into your anchor line and we'll call it good, <Hamilton's commentary in
TW4 says of Gen 2:25, "The climax of the creation is, interestingly, the notation that the couple were naked
and felt no shame before each other." Gen 3:10 is the reversal of that, so their shame must have been in front
of each other." 
\fac JW 2 - Thanks.
\ln 02.08 
\ln 02.09
\con NP1: Good testing here. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but if the hearer took it as them stealing God's
fruit, then he's not really understanding what happened. It's not like someone telling his neighbor, "OK, this
tree is mine, you can't take it's fruit, eat fruit from your own trees." The main motive behind eve eating the
fruit (and God forbidding it) is missing. Or almost  missing, the snake talks about it in line 5. But you might
consider naming the trees at the beginning of the story "tree that makes you know right and wrong" to help
with this. 
\fac JW 1 - I've made some notes about this.
\con NP2: Interesting that the reteller said, "Deus percebeu que tinha alguem".....Is Imere not all knowing? That
may be one of those things you'll have to make sure and work into the storyset. 
\fac JW 2 - Got it.
\ln 02.10
\con NP2: Dude, the reteller gave Eve the lead again. Is Bondo culture woman dominant? I don't guess there's
anything to change here. Why do you think the reteller keeps doing this?
\fac JW 2 - Woman is definitely not dominant.  I'm not sure if this is relevant but the reteller is very close to his
grandmother who happens to be probably the most revered woman in the tribe.  In addition, this guy actually
comes across as having some 'feminine qualities'?
\con NP1: <nós estamos com vergonha porque estamos pelados> -- How does this fit with Bondo culture? Are they
ashamed at nakedness? Will it be a problem/confusing for the ones that haven't had much exposure to the
outside world when they hear this?
\fac JW1 - I've added a relevant testing question.  I do remember Oiope talking about nakedness during a testing
session but I'll have to go back and look.  
\con NP1: Also related to this, or maybe the opposite, in some cultures you have to be very careful about how you
talk about nakedness and sex and stuff. And it can be different depending on who's talking and who's
listening. A lot of times you have to use a euphemism to convey the concept.....just some things to keep in mind.
\fac JW 1 - Thanks.
\con NP2: Hmmmmm, the reteller said <estamos com vergonha um do outro> again. This one seems a little different
than ln 7. They probably did cover themselves with leaves because they were ashamed between themselves. But
I don't think they hid because of that? What do you think?   
\fac JW 2 - I do think they hid because they were ashamed.  Do you not think their nakedness was the surface
reason for their shame?
\con NP3: I agree that they hid because they were ashamed. The question is who were they ashamed to be with when
they hid? each other or God?
\fac JW 3 - I'll just enter this as an additional testing question.  Let me know if you want me to do anything else for
now.  
\ln 02.11
\ln 02.12
\con NP1: <Ele disse que a gente nÃ£o ia morrer...o Deus estÃ¡ falando isso porque Ele nÃ£o quer que voces fique igual
Ele> -- This is a little too much embelishment, since all eve said was that the snake tricked her. 
\fac JW 1 - ok
\con NP1: You may not be able to answer this, but I'd be curious to know if the bondo see the snake as the hero in
this story because he was able to trick the people. All your testing questions got neutral answers, the closest
thing was "the snake wanted to kill them". 
\fac JW 1 - I didnt get this impression from the other two testing sessions (of the original crafted story).  Do you
think it would be good to come right out and ask this or to atleast ask something that might solicit a more
specific response?
\con NP2: Probably so. 
\fac JW 2 - I added more testing.
\ln 02.13
\con NP2: The reteller left this line out. He has done an incredible job with the rest of the story, so maybe this
should tell us something. Keep an eye on this line in the future. 
\fac JW 2 - Got it.
\ln 02.14
\con NP1: There are several difficult-to-translate things in this line. So be sure you read what's in TW4 about it
and test it thoroughly. The hard parts could be: (1) how to translate seed/offspring/descendant. (2) the
prophetic nature of it in general. (3) strike heel being a non-deadly blow. (4) strike head being a deadly blow. 
\fac JW 1 - 10/4 (as in 'good buddy').  I have a question about this...since this is such an obscure 'prophecy' (in my
opinion)...at least one that would be difficult to pick up on in a 12-15 story set (I may be wrong here), would it
be acceptable just to leave off the following part, "her offspring will attack your head, and you will attack her
offspring's heel" (netbible)...essentially keep v.14 and sum up v.15 by saying something like 'I will put hostility
between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring' and then maybe going on to say
something like 'and if you read the end of the Book, we win'
\con NP2: Ummmmm, is there a word for 'read' in Bondo? Really though, why do you say it's obscure? The
messianic-ness of it obscure, definitely. But the fact that the snake (who they will hopefully associate with
Satan) gets beat in the end is pretty obvious, and that's central to the redemptive theme. Maybe that's what
you're saying. It's OK to genericize, so suggest a more generic version of the line than the 'end of the book'
thing, there are a few ways I can think of to do it. 
\fac JW 2 - They use the same word as 'to look' (enen).  Example:  Petkom enenang torempanpot.  "The woman is
looking at (reading) her book.''  When I said 'obscure', I was just referencing the supposed messianic element
of the prophecy.  Honestly, beyond that, I hadnt really thought about the fact that the snake getting beat in the
end is obvious and that it is central to the redemptive them.  As for your question, are you talking about
something like ''You will be an enemy of the woman and her offspring.  You will attack her offspring, but her
offspring will defeat you?
\con NP3: I looked into this a little more and I'll agree with you somewhat. It looks like the majority view is that the
woman's 'seed' will destroy the snake, but it's definitely not clear cut, some commentaries question if it means
the snake will be destroyed. What is the gyst of the curse/promise to the snake in your opinion? I would be OK
with leaving out the line if you want. It's up to you. 
\fac JW 3 - I'm kind of getting lost in the thread here...what line exactly would you be okay with leaving out (all of
line 14 in the story)?  To answer your question, for me the basic gyst of the curse/promise to the snake is that
disobedience to God merits punishment/consequences...fundamentally speaking.  As to the specific
curse/promise I basically take away that the snake's life is going to suck...as an animal.  And that if the snake
is indeed an embodiment of Satan, that there will be this consistent enmity throughout history between man and
Satan which will ultimately result in some suffering on our part, but worse suffering on his.  Are you okay with
us trying, 'You will be an enemy of the woman and her offspring.  You will attack her offspring, but her
offspring will defeat you?' as a possible replacement for the current line 14? 
\con NP2: Retelling says, <As gerações dela vão pisar na cobra, nas suas gerações, e as suas gerações vão picar no calcanhar
e as gerações dela vão te esmagar.> He made the only sense out of it that he could, that the snake was just a snake,
so Eve's descendants couldn't kill the snake himself, it would have to be the snake's descendants. A few of
things you could do to help with this: 1) Say that the snake is Satan and anchor it with rev 12:9. 2) Say in the
Spirit world story that Satan tries to trick people and then make sure they use the same verb in this story when
Eve says "the snake tricked me". 3) Just make sure it's right in this story, and even if they don't initially make
the connection (like this guy) keep checking for it until they do....without you giving it away of course. 
\fac JW 2 - Do you think there's a preferred option out of the 3 you gave me?
\con NP3: It depends on the testing. There are basically two variables, meaning (M) and form (F). You want both to
match scripture as closely as possible. If you have to sacrifice form to maintain the meaning, then do it. Don't
sacrifice meaning to maintain form. And only sacrifice as much form as you need to to maintain the meaning,
sacrifice only the amount of form that is necessary to get the right meaning across. I outlined three variations
of the form above where 3 is closest to scripture and 1 is furthest. So do the highest number you can that still
gets the meaning across. 

If you think this guy's understanding is going to be typical, then that would eliminate #3. So try #2 next and
test it and see if it works. There are obviously other variables, such as the amount of time you have available
to work on this with crafters and testers. 
\fac JW 3 - I'm going to err on the side of assuming that his understanding is going to by typical.  If I discover
something different, I'll return to option 3.  For now, I've made notes in Creation and Fall about trying option
2.  If this doesn't work, I'll make the direct connection using the Rev anchor.
\ln 02.15
\con NP1: <desde inicio da sua gravidez voce vai sentir dor de barriga> -- can you find support for this? Does the
text imply anything more than the time of childbirth? 
\fac JW 1 - Can't we use personal experience as anchors.  Larissa had some pain throughout.  Something like
Lar.01.09 (how do you create a jump path again?)
\con NP2: It was an honest question, I didn't know if there was support or not. Now that I've looked, I see that
there is. (I just like to keep you on your toes.) Translator's Notes says people have translated it the way you
did, but doesn't recommend it. Translator's Handbook recommends it. So paste that into your anc line and
you're good. 
\fac JW 2 - Thanks for the help.
\ln 02.16
\con NP1: <vai ser preguiçoso> -- I didn't know that word, but my diccionary says it means lazy. If it's part of the
curse, then I don't see it as anchorable. If it's more like, "you've had it easy up until now, but...." then it's OK.  
\fac JW 1 - Got it
\con NP2: The retelling for this line looks fine. So if the story matches the retelling more or less, then you're OK. 
\fac JW 2 - ok
\ln 02.17
\con NP1: <(12.12-12.14?) voce nÃ£o vai morrer (12.15-12.17?)> -- There's nothing like this in bt2, and with the
question marks I don't know what to make of it. I need to know the context to know if it's OK or not. If it's
communicating "in order to not die (you'll have to plant food)" it's probably OK. 
\fac JW 1 - I'll look into it
\ln 02.18
\con NP1: <você vai ser enterrado na terra> -- do some testing of this phrase. Does it mean buried or "dirt"-ed (like
turn to dirt)? Or is it figurative maybe?

falava, mas agora você vai arrastar no chão, você vai comer capim, sujeira. Então dai quando Ele deu esse castigo
para cobra> -- I can understand the reteller throwing this on at the end because he skipped it earlier. But where
did the first part come from? 
\fac JW 2 - As I referenced earlier, this reteller also told a traditional story about a snake so there is most likely
some background info on the snake coming in from that story?
\ln 02.19
\con NP1: <espiritos> (bt) & <mostro> (bt2, is that monster?) -- start an L&C entry for this, or add a link to it from this
line of the bt record. 
\fac JW 1 - Start an L&C entry for these Portuguese words or for 'wonkinom'?  I've already got and L&C for
'wonkinom'.  Does 'espiritos' and 'mostro' need to go somewhere inside the 'wonkinom' L&C?
\con NP2: No, we only care about the bondo words, we're just using portuguese to talk about them and try to
understand them. Put in the L&C entry that espiritos & mostro were two of the ways it was BTed. Also, (1) add a
note to every first occurence of a key term in each story that says something like (backslash)cn see L&C entry
espirito. That way readers (me especially) will know there's more info on it there. Also (2) send me your L&C
database now, and then whenever you make majorish additions to it. For this entry discuss (in the L&C record)
the differences (or similarity/sameness) between wonkinom, which is angel here, and whatever word you have
for demon.  
\fac JW 2 - Noted
\con NP3: I don't see the crafting note pointing to the L&C entry. Am I looking in the right place? 
\fac JW 3 - It's in there now.  Let me know if it's right because it's my first note like this (pointing to a L&C entry)
\ln 02.20
\con NP1: Just like the Creation story, there is a lot of variation between the two backtranslations in this story. I
had said that shorter lines would help tighten them up in my creation connotes. Another way to help with that is
to break up the story into individual sound files (I can walk you through this on audacity). You could do it with
the original storyteller so you can know where to break them. Have the storyteller tell you what it means in
Portuguese so you can make the bits as short as possible but still being complete clauses. It will also help you
with language learning. Then when you get your backtranslation first play the whole file all the way through.
Then play the first 'chunk' and get that backtranslated. Try to get to where you can understand all the parts of
the chunk and what they become in the backtranslation. Don't go on to the next chunk until you and the BTer
are confident it's accurate. This will also help you make sure the two backtranslations (if you continue doing
two) follow the same line numbers. Anyway, do this if you think it will help. It will add some work, but it might
be worth it.

\con NP1: Good job on this story. They keep improving, which is good. The backtranslation pieces are still a little
long. If you have to use more than one line very often then they're too long and probably less accurate than
they could be. Your testing of this story is great. The anchoring needs to be tightened up in a few places. The

\ln 03.03a
\con NP1: Re. your question about deus de mentira vs deus que nao era verdade, tell me what you know about it.
What is it in Bondo? Why did the tester/reteller use 'deus falso' in lns 03 and 04?
\fac JW 1 - Just so you'll know, the primary source used 'deus falso' and 'deus que não era de verdade' so on that
note, I guess it would be better for the primary source to go with one way of expressing the idea.  The heart of
my question was do you think 'god of lies' is essentially the same as 'god that was not true'.  I think what I
wanted conveyed through the primary source was 'god that was not real', but I'm not necessarily displeased
with how it came out.  In your mind, was Baal not real at all or was something actually there...maybe just not the
One True God?  I'm not sure about the Bondo language here, however it seems that all of these ideas are
closely related.  Tomka gave the retelling and it was of the original orally crafted story.  His backtranslation is
the one you see interspersed in this file and it was of the revised story.  I really need to get fresh
backtranslations of the revised stories because they were backtranslated by the same guys who backtranslated
the original orally crafted stories.
\con NP2: In my mind, there was definitely something there that they worshiped, it wasn't just empty worship but a
demon like some of your anchors say. I would need to know more about what the Bondo is to say if it works or
not. If 'god of lies' is more like 'god who tells lies' I would need to think/research a bit more. Are there many
instances of demons telling lies in scripture? Probably, but I can't think of any. If 'god of lies' means 'god that
we were lied to about' (ie he wasn't really God), then it's definitely OK. I think connecting Baal with demons
(either explicitly or implicitly) would fit better with your theme than making him not exist though. Would it not
work to call him by his name in the story.

Start an L&C entry for it. 
\fac JW 1 - Short answer...I don't know.  What's interesting is that Renato and I have avoided 'palavra de Deus' in
the primary sources?
\con NP2: That's what I thought. So that either means it's natural or someone in the process (crafter or BTer) knew
the Bible enough to add it in. I'm guessing it's natural, but you should ask about it. Ask them how they might use
it in everday life.

\con NP1: I don't remember if I've asked this before, but are you doing the testing in Hunsrik? Are you recording it
and translating to Portuguese? Just wondering what your process is.

\con NP1: STORY FLOW: It looks like this line is missing from the current version of the story but it's necessary
for the story to make sense. 
\ln 06.05
\con NP1: STORY FLOW: This is the first time the name 'Eva' is used the set. Depending on what the natural way to
introduce someone's name into a story in Hunsrik, I would expect something like, "it went to the woman, whose
name was Eve, ...." in line 2. Look at the natural (non-Bible) stories you've recorded and analyzed and look at
how names are introduced. Technically, she doesn't get her name until after God says that she will have kids.
But it's OK to name her before if the language uses names more often than man/woman/boy/etc or kinship
terms (like husband/wife). So look at that in your natural stories too. 
\ln 06.06
\con NP1: STORY FLOW: similar thing for introducing Adam's name. Although it may mainly be in your creation
story. 
\ln 06.07
\con NP1: INFERENCE TESTING: do some testing to make sure that "abriu os olhos deles" is understood. A question
like, "why do you think their eyes were opened?" You may need to ask a followup question if they just answer
with something like 'because they ate the fruit'. 
\p
\con NP1: TRANS ISSUES: Also on "abriu os olhos deles". Look out for an issue with passive. Most major language
translations have a passive there "their eyes were opened", where the agent is unspecified. Does hunsrik have
a passive? Is this passive in hunsrik? If it doesn't feel natural in hunsrik you could remove the figure of
speech with something like "they realized something had happened".

the story set usually. 
\ln 06.17
\con NP1: TRANS ISSUE and STORY FLOW: <Tu quer sempre ficar com os seu marido mais ele vai te dominar.> --
this line seems pretty tight to the hebrew/almeida form. And with the young man you tested with not answering,
I might look for something more natural. (I know there were other reasons that the man probably didn't answer,
but this may have played a part.) Look at some different English and Portuguese (and German?) translations and
talk to your crafter about it.

\con JP2 -- -- Very nice! Please get one retelling of the new version.
\fac AW2 -- We did one more retelling (new record 01a), which we found was quite good. She just forgot that the
man was sleeping and that he was exited about his new 'friend'.
\con JP3  -- Good, I looked at your newest retelling. She did tell most of the story, but she used a a number of
different wordings. Usually our goal is a crafted story that is so natural and reproducible that the retellers use
a lot of the same wording. It might be that the people who have been your retellers don't want to listen to the
story 3 or 4 times in order to really learn it. But if they ARE listening that many times, and then still using
wordings that vary as much as these, You and your crafter might want to take a good look at the retellings to
see if perhaps the way they've said it might be a bit more natural.

\con JP1 -- Andre, if you could give distinct names to the format markers for Indonesian (or Lo'am) and English , it
would help me out. I would like to be able to hide the languages that I don't read. If the format markers are
distinct, I can do that using the "hide field" toggle in the View menu. So, for example, if you had a qtst-e and
qtst-i (or maybe it's L?) I could hide the one I don't need.  I would do the same with the retellings if you could
number the bts that correspond to the various retellings.
\fac AW1 -- Done. We use the original (e.g. gtst, tst) for English and added -id for Indonesian and plm for Lo'am.
For different languages we use different font colours. For the kind of marker we use different font styles. So
it shouldn't be a problem to read only the English text by hiding the id and plm text (though people here mix id
and plm).
\con JP2 -- Thanks!  It works  well.

\con JP1 -- good testing Qs!

\con JP1 -- Re. the retellings, since this is just Stage 1 consultation, and therefore primarily mentoring, I have only
commented on the retellings down through line 8. That should give you a good idea of the kinds of things to
note based on the retellings.  So, in the future you can draw these conclusions yourself and either note them in
the BT record using a format marker like "\co" and then send them to me--if you want some feedback.  Or you
can go right ahead and recraft the story based on your evaluations of the retellings. Then redo the BT, get
NEW retellings and send those files to me. Either way is  fine with me.
\fac AW1 -- Ok. Thanks.

\ln 01.01
\con JP3 -- Notice that the new retelling didn't mention that God was the one who created it all. In fact, only one of
the four retellings mentioned God as creator. This may suggest that you need to make a bolder point of God as
creator if you want it to be retold. OR you could revise the crafted story to make it more like the retellings.
\ln 01.02
\con JP1 -- can you explain to me what the curly brackets { } indicate in the \en line? 
\fac AW1 -- With our first backtranlator we were not really happy. So we will use someone else for the recrafting
and the next stories. However for this time, when there are differences between the original and the bt, in the
English line the text in {} means it is from the bt, the text in () means it is from the original.
\con JP2 -- ok, thanks.

\ln 01.03
\con JP1 -- notice that both rtl2 and rtl3 felt the need to explain why the form needed breath (it didn't breath yet).
You might think about adding that to the crafted story.
\fac AW1 -- I forgot to mention that rtl3 did was present when rtl2 was retelling. It wasn't planned that rtl3 would
retell too, but he did. We think that's good, but we have to consider that. I added a note in the Retellings file.
\con JP2 -- ok, good. If you've updated your retelling file, please send it to me also.

\ln 01.04

\con JP1 -- That might be a good idea
\fac AW1 -- Omitted.
\con JP2 -- good.

\con JP1 -- re "in the east side" -- since both the retellers got this wrong, I think it might be best to not specify a
direction. Just say "After that God made a park."
\fac AW1 -- Done.
\con JP2 -- good

\ln 01.06
\con JP1 -- the retellers didn't really say much about the plants and fruits being beautiful or delicious. This seems
like an important part of the story, so perhaps it can be made more prominent and memorable in some way.
\fac AW1 -- Done.
\con JP2 -- good

\ln 01.07
\con JP1 -- Why do you suppose rtl2 & 3 missed this?
\fac AW1 -- In their version of the story, I think, there was only one tree. So they might be confused. One tester
said, there were even three special trees. We made it more understandable now.
\con JP2 -- good. Once you've finished revising this story, please get another retelling and send it.

\co INFERENCE TST: Good work

\con JP1 -- re INFO -- please send information about Dona, Wida, Agus & Rio to put into the mini-bios database. We
need to know things like, male/female, approximate age, education level, religion. It's particularly important
for us to know if they qualify as UNS if they are doing testing and backtranslating.

\fac (from email 18aug) We have one question: We did not pay crafters until now, because we heard it should be
more of a "relational" project. Our main crafter, who crafted/re-crafted the first three stories,
"disappeared". And we have difficulties to find a new crafter. What do you think about offering a small
payment for their willingness to help crafting?
\con JP1 -- I'm sending you a pdf file with some pros and cons about that.  (If I forget to attach it, send me a
reminder! :-)

\con JP1 -- re RETELLING -- I see that in a few places some of the retellers missed whole lines. In those places, if
you see that the information is given in another place in their retelling, please note that with parenthese, i.e. if
the info should have been in line 3 but the reteller re-ordered it to line five, you could put "(see line 5)" in the
retelling for line 3.  If they completely leave out the information, then put dashes in "---". 

\ln 02.01
\ln 02.02
\con JP1 -- Since one of the testing respondents thought that the snake was just guessing, it will be good to get a
third opinion on this line.  What the snake says should be understood as him (the snake) trying to trick her, not
just fishing for information. So, depending on what the third testing shows you, you may need to revise the
wording slightly to use whatever tactic the language uses to make the snake's words sound tricky.

info in line six. If you feel that it needs to be part of the story, then either test one more time and see if it
makes it into the retelling, or give it a bit more emphasis in the crafted story so that it is easier to remember.

\ln 02.06
\con JP1 -- re "you are able to be like God" -- I looked at the L&C Note you sent for "God" (Tuhan). It talks about
who uses the term.  But it would also be good to tell in the L&C Note what a UNS's concept of God is. What is
God like? What does do? Does he have a location? What interaction does he typically have with man? etc.

\con JP1 -- re "snake was it who gave me" -- make sure this doesn't imply that the snake somehow passed the fruit to
her to eat, or forced her to eat it.  The meaning of her comment here should be that the snake tricked her into
eating it. Rtl2 seems to have said it more correctly. Dod he or she already know the story? Or is the BT of the
crafted story incorrect?

\ln 02.16
\con JP1 -- re "cursed" -- Curse is a keyterm and needs a record in the L&C Notes.  Please tell who can make curses
(can good people make curses?). Are they always binding? Is there a way to avoid them? etc.

\ln 02.17
\ln 02.18
\con JP1 -- Notice that all three retellers said that God cursed the woman.  Check the commentaries to see if that is
a valid interpretation of vs 16. I think most of them agree that he cursed the snake and the ground, but not the
humans. But see what you can find.  If there isn't evidence that God cursed the woman, then it would be good
to revise the crafted story. Even though your story doesn't say "cursed", it is interpreted that way. So find a
way to explain the consequences for the woman so that it isn't interpreted as God cursing her.  

\ln 02.19
\con JP1 -- re "curse" -- same discussion as in line 18.

\con 2009-09-29

\ln 02.01
\co Here's a potential question: "What kinds of things about the snake do you think made him "most smart from all
animals"?"
\ln 02.02
\co Q: "Where do you think person human woman came from?"
\ln 02.03
\co as you suspect from the anchor, this rendering of the question by the snake is misleading, who was clearly
challenging God (see \cn in BT file). Do you have any good "trickster" stories in your collection that might
suggest a good way to imply his being crafty?
\co Q: "How is it do you think that a snake is talking in this story?"
\ln 02.04
\co be sure the background information here (i.e. what tree in the center, etc) is in the earlier creation story so
that this reference here make sense. We've included a number of possible testing questions from which you
can choose what you think will be interesting... roughly 1 question for every 2-3 lines.
\co Q: "What was it about the plant which in very center that they weren't supposed to eat?"
\co Q: "Who said this?"
\co Q: "Why do you think they would die if they ate the fruit?"
\ln 02.05
\co Q: "How do you think the snake knew they "you guys not die"?"
\ln 02.06
\co Is it clear from the passive form of this verse who's doing what the giving?
\co Q: "Why do you think it is given also to her husband?"
\ln 02.07
\co So that the following question might make more sense, it might be good to include also here that "they were
hiding". And then include a testing question like, "Why do you think they hid?"
\co I know that you used Word to edit this story, but in Toolbox for the the anchor to be able to jump properly to
the NetBible, you need to add a '0' to pad the verse number.
\ln 02.08
\ln 02.09
\co The rendering here is probably fine (i.e. unpacking the rhetorical question). gen.03:09 would also work to
anchor this verse. See also the \cn line in the BT file.
\co Q: "Why do you think the Lord Creator asked this question?"
\ln 02.10
\co The rendering here is very indirect (as if the agent of his being "ordered" is unknown). Is there some
(discourse?) reason why this is said in such an indirect/passive way? The emotional force of the source text
is that Adam basically blames his failure on his wife and that seems to be missing (unless this is the way that he
blames her in this language). See testing question?
\co The implicational force of Adam's response is to blame both Eve and God (for giving her to him) for his
failure. But by using a passive construction (i.e. "I was given/ordered to eat fruit") is it clear that he's
"passing the buck"? Probe this to find out and maybe you could ask a question like, "Who do you think God will
think (from hearing this comment by Adam) who gave him the fruit?"
\ln 02.11
\co Good question that you have in the anchor line, but it would be better to be in a separate 'co' (comment line) in
the BT file, which we'll move here to the ConNotes files.
\co Q: "Why do you think no one admitted to eating the fruit?"
\ln 02.12
\co the snake *tricked* her, but she doesn't really say that he "ordered" her to do it.
\ln 02.13
\co as you noted in the anchor, this isn't really anchorable and should be left out. See also \cn
\ln 02.14
\co Q: "Why do you think the Lord Creator punished the snake?
\co Q: "Why do you think being made to walk on your stomach is a punishment?"
\ln 02.15
\co I think what you have here is ok.  It's interesting (to me, anyway) that the scripture passage says, specifically
"the *woman*" and "*her* seed" whereas you have just *that human*. I could find nothing in the exegetical
helps which would imply that there's some special meaning regard the 'woman-ness' of the enemyhood, so I
think this is ok. Is there something in the reference system that forces "that human" to refer specifically to
the woman (as opposed to the man or both indiscrimately).
\co Q: "What do you think this "enemyhood" will involve?"
\ln 02.16
\ln 02.17
\co Do followup on this to make sure who does what to whom, which seems incorrect from the BT (as you noted).
\ln 02.18
\co Is there some reason that you have the punishments coming in the order: 1) snake, 2) man, 3) woman when the
biblical story has it: snake, woman, and then man? If the crafter just gave it out of order, then maybe you
should revise to be in the same order (esp, if you have "After that" in one of the punishments). In the "blind
man" story, he has the order as in the scripture, so probably no special reason for the reordering.
\ln 02.19
\ln 02.20
\ln 02.21
\co Try to get another recording, because if you have bad audio at this point, then it's not going to be possible to
get good  retelling testing feedback.
\ln 02.22
\ln 02.23
\co re: 02.22 - 02.25, it sounds like you recognize the problems here... just work with the team to revise this part.
\co Q: "Why do you think the Lord Creator was given unto them these clothes?"
\co As you mention about the "But wrong detail there", if you end up keeping "wood skin", then be sure to probe
that with a question to find out whether you have an accuracy issue?
