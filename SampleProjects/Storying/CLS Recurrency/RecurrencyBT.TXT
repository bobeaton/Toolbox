\t Target audience and redemptive themes
\stg Bkgrnd (Bulgarian)
\bt Target audience: Pomak (the older generation)
\co The Pomatzi (plural of Pomak), or Bulgarian Muslims, are a Muslim minority people group in Bulgaria,
which is a mainly Bulgarian Orthodox Christian nation. The Pomatzi are ethnically Bulgarian, but their
ancestors were converted to Islam during the rule by the Ottoman Empire, which lasted from the
fifteenth till nineteenth century. Though in name they hold on to their Muslim identity, in practice they
have been largely influenced by Communism and tend to know very little about Islam. They also hold
animistic and folk-Islamic beliefs, especially the older generation. The Pomatzi live largely in the
southern part of Bulgaria and also in parts of Greece, Macedonia and Turkey.

\bt Redemptive theme: Relationship
\co Across the board, relationships appear to be very important to Bulgarians. People are very aware of
family ties, "everybody knows everybody", and interpersonal relations are prioritized. However, for
the older generation loneliness appears to be an issue as many have lost their spouses and their children
are often far away for work or study. With (the end of) Communism, materialism and individualism also
seem to have set in, resulting in more of an 'every man for himself' attitude. As for their image of God,
Communism has taught them there is no God and what they have learned about the religious God of their
(grand)parents, He is rather distant and more about rituals than personal relationship. In this story set,
we want to show God interacting with and relating to  people on a very personal and understandable
way. We also want to emphasize that God is with us.

\bt Redemptive theme: Trust
\co After Communism fell, Democracy did not bring what people might have hoped for. People are
thoroughly and explicitly disappointed in politics and have no faith in the government, which used to
take care of almost every aspect of their lives (work, education, faith, etc.). People feel that there is no
one looking after them any more, and they have to take care of themselves. This includes feeling
forgotten by God. There is a saying that goes something like "God helps, but He doesn't put food on the
table." In this story set, we want to show God's provision, faithfulness, and concern for people.

\co Crafter: GM - Orthodox/Atheist/Communist from a nearby Christian Village. Around 50 years old. Has
never read the Bible before, but has attended the Orth. church.

Has read and heard a little about the Bible but not much. 30Jan09
\co Resources: Bulgarian bibles (Bulgarian Bible Association, Living Word, Orthodox), first crafted story
(by GM), slide show pictures (Sarah, is that correct?)
\co Test 1: ZK - early fifties, our people group, from M village, identifies herself as M but doesn't
practice, only knows about her religion from what her grandmother told her, semi-atheist
\co Test 2: RC - early thirties, our people group, from M parents who didn't practice, doesn't practice
herself, presumably atheist. 13Jul08
\co Test 3: ER - early twenties, our people group, from M village, M parents who didn't practice, materialist
but aware that something like God might exist, student. Retelling: Fairly accurate retelling. Got the
action and names in but left out almost everything God said, except the command to go. Left out the
promises, except that Abram would have posterity. Added details here and there ("Avram went out on a
walk and heard a voice", "Avram thought about it and decided to obey"). 26May09
\co Test 4: FH - mid twenties, our people group, from more concervative M village, M parents practice and
take their faith seriously, husband Turkish and very religious.

\t RICH YOUNG MAN
\stg S-by-S (Bulgarian) SH
\co Language: Bulgarian
\co Reason for having this story in the set: For the relationship theme, in this story we see Jesus
prioritizing relationship (with the children), and it says how Jesus liked the young ruler. Also, people
are very aware of "being a good person". In this story, Jesus says only God is good.

\ln 79.01
\bt Children come to Isus and his students to touch Him. But Isus students take them away.
\anc mrk.10:13
\rtl1 The children come to Jesus and his students who want to touch Him. And Jesusí students become to chase
them away. 
\rtl2 A lot of children have come to Jesus to talk with him. Then his students have tried to chase them away, 
\ln 79.02
\bt And Isus says to leave them with Him because the Gods kingdom is for such.
\anc mrk.10:14
\rtl1 But He says them to leave them and He has blessed them, 
\rtl2 but Jesus has said to them to stop 
\ln 79.03
\bt Who doesnt accept the Gods kingdom as a child, he will never go into it. 
\co NP: "As a child" interpreted by backtranslator and testers as "while you are a litle child (age)".
\anc mrk.10:15
\rtl1 and said that from the childrenís age have to accept the Godís kingdom, because who hasnít accepted
from the young age, it become difficult later. 
\rtl2 because the children have to learn from their young age for some things and in that way to come in and
to learn about the Godís kingdom. And also He has said to the students that the Godís kingdom is
represented from children. 
\tst How does a child accept things, like presents, candy etc?
\tsta RC: Maybe Jesus is saying that a person has to be taught when he is young to be good, to not steal or lie,
to believe in God, to receive this faith and everything he teaches. Because if you teach them from the
beginning then when the children grow up they will be good people. When people are older and they
havent been taught as children, its a little harder maybe. Thats maybe what hes trying to say, they need
to be taught when theyre children to receive these things.
\tsta ER: With pleasure and joy.
\ln 79.04
\bt After that He blesses them.
\anc mrk.10:16
\rtl2 Then the children have become to speak with Jesus and He has blessed them. 
\tst What do you think he did or said to "bless them"
\tsta RC: Maybe he told them something good. (SH: Do you understand this word Blagoslavi (bless them) or is
it a little religious?) Its religious but Blago (means generous, good) it means he told something good.
\tsta ER: Like people normally bless a person. With blessings: he declares words over them and blesses. And
he 'crosses' them. (SH: What kind of words?) May God bless you.
\ln 79.05 
\bt A man meets Isus on the street and says to Him: Generous teacher, how can I inherit the life
forever?
\anc mrk.10:17
\co NP: Generous - The word for "blag" used here was intended to mean "very good" (better than just good,
or dober), but was mistaken first for "mlad" (young) and translated differently. Should be changed to
"dober". RECRAFT??
\cn Bulgarian-English Dictionary (Blag - gentle, kind, sweet character, good.)
\rtl1 After that Jesus meets a man who also says to Jesus that he wants to be (alive) forever. 
\rtl2 After some time, Jesus has met a young man on the street, who has turned to Him with the words: ìSweet
teacher, can I ask you something?î Then Jesus has said ìTell me, what do you want to ask me?î And he has
answered: ìHow can I reach life forever?î 
\ln 79.06
\bt Then Isus says to him why you tell me that I am generous? Generous is only the God.
\anc mrk.10:18
\rtl2 Jesus has asked him: ìWhy do you name me sweet? You can name in that way only the God. Only the God
is sweet.î 
\co SH: RECRAFT?? - Generous to Good
\tst In your opinion what does it mean to be generous?
\tsta RC: To be good. (SH: Its the same as good?) Yes.
\tsta ER: It means a person who gives all of himself for others. "Blag", someone who gives many things. A
sweet, good person. (NP: Do you know such a person?) Yes, I know such people. (NP: What are they
like?) Good, generous ("blagi").
\tst Why do you think Jesus says "Generous is only the God." ?
\tsta RC: Maybe because on earth there arent any such clean... Maybe because God is the one who teaches
people about goodness and generousness (Blag) and he teaches them this goodness and hes the only one
who baptizes the sinners, while people here on earth arent like this.
\tsta ER: Because this man has asked for something from him, more accurately: he has asked how he can give
him eternal life, and Jesus answered that only God can do that. God has eternal life.
\ln 79.07
\bt After that He tells to him that the life will be inherited 
\anc mat.19:17
\rtl2 Then Jesus has said to this man that 
\tst What is the life that will be inherited... in your opinion?
\tsta RC: The truth is there isnt any such thing as eternal life, but when a person lives a good life and people
love him he will be a long time in their hearts. Thats it; that throughout all life people will leave but when
they follow Gods laws thru this they will stay forever. (SH: So there is no after life?) Maybe there is, I
dont know.
\tsta ER: I think that by eternal life is understood that as a person will be immortal; to never die and never
disappear from planet earth. But there are no such immortal people, at least not on our planet.
\ln 79.07.1
\bt if he keeps in the orders dont lie, dont steal, dont kill, respect your mother and your father.
\anc mrk.10:19
\rtl2 if you keep the rules in all your life donít to steal, donít to lie, donít to commit adultery, and if you keep
well with your mother and father, then you can get what do you want, in other words, life forever. 
\ln 79.08
\bt Then the man answers to Him that he knows these orders from his young years.
\anc mrk.10:20
\rtl1 And he says that he lives with the Godís rules from his young age, and that he doesnít steal, doesnít lie
from his young age. 
\rtl2 And the man has answered that he keep all that rules from his young age and that in the moment he is
rich. 
\co Does "know" imply "obey" too, like in the text?
\tst What does it mean that "he knows these orders from his youth"?
\tsta RC: That he lives that way. He follows Gods laws and he lives correctly, even from the time when he was
young as a child. Thats the way he was brought up and thats the way he lives. He doesnt sin.
\tsta ER: It means that he has come across these things before, and has learned them. Someone has told him
them, maybe his parents and family. So he's known it since he was a child, since he was young, because
somebody had told him. They have guided him, advised him not to do such things and to respect his
mother and father.
\tst Why do you think he has to follow these laws?
\tsta RC: As a child he was brought up this way. And a person who thinks this way will follow the laws without
even trying, because thats how he was raised and thats how his life is.
\tsta ER: Because if he doesn't keep them, that's very bad, very negative. Every reasonable person knows it's
very wrong to kill, to steal, to lie. These our things every person knows are very bad and shouldn't be
done.
\ln 79.09
\bt Isus likes him and tell to him that one isnt enough for him (NP: he lacks one thing) to get that
aim/ goal: to sell everything that he has and to give the money to poor people.
\anc mrk.10:21
\cn CONNOT: In view of his feeling for him, the negative opener is a surprise, and might be made
smoother, ‚ÄòBut, nonetheless, He said, ‚Äò¬†.¬†.¬†.¬†‚Äô 
\rtl1 But he is a rich man, and Jesus says to him that he has to sell all his riches and to give it to the poor
people. 
\rtl2 Then Jesus has said to him: ìIf you are rich, sell everything and that what will you win, give everything
to poor people.î 
\co SH: RECRAFT: Add "treasure in heaven" and "follow Me"?
\tst Why do you think all that the young man has done, isn't enough? 
\tsta RC: Because a person shouldnt want to have everything for himself. You have to think about others who
dont have. And this is the one thing he hadnt followed. He is extremely well off and he lives according
to Gods laws but the one thing he hasnt fulfilled is that there are poor people and he has to give to them
as well.
\tsta ER: Because he has to absolutely everything for it to be enough, in other words to continue all his life
until death to help, to give to people, do do only kind/ good things, in order to have eternal life. To have
eternal life after he dies, perhaps. 'Cause I understood that he wanted to live forever without dying,
but there's no way that can happen. Only Jesus rose from the dead.
\ln 79.10
\bt The man disappoints (NP: is disappointed) because he has been rich and disappoints (NP: felt
sad/ hurt), and goes.
\anc mrk.10:22
\rtl1 Then the rich man has become sad and went. 
\rtl2 Then the man has become sad and went. 
\ln 79.11
\bt Then Isus turns to his students and tells them that very difficult rich people will go into skys
kingdom (Gods kingdom)
\anc mrk.10:23
\rtl1 And Jesus has said
\rtl2 After that Jesus has arrived to his students. He has become to speak with them and he has turned to
them with the words: ìIt is difficult to the rich people to come in the Godís kingdom. 
\tst Where is this sky's kingdom do you think?
\tsta RC: In the sky/heaven, with God. 
\tsta ER: In the sky. In other words, on this earth, but in the sky.
\ln 79.12
\bt and it is easier camel goes during (NP: through) needle ears than the rich goes to the Gods
kingdom.
\anc mrk:10:25
\rtl1 that more easily the camel go during needleís ears than the rich man separate from his riches. 
\rtl2 It is so difficult as the camels can pass in needleís ears.î 
\co Backtranslator smiles, seemingly amused.
\co LM during onsite: Check on the exact meaning of the proverb in Jesus' time, and compare it to how it is
interpreted by the people here; "impossible" or just "very difficult"?
\tst If you had to use a Bulgarian proverb to say this, what is it? And what does it mean?
\tsta RC: (Sh: she couldnt think of any at the moment so I asked: What does this saying mean, a camel thru..?)
That its impossible. Bulgarian has such proverbs but I cant think of an exact one right now. But this one
is great.
\tsta ER: (laughing) A collegue of mine had made a mistake and this woman of about 30 years old therefore
had to pay a certain amount of money, but she said: "Even if Safinka climbs on top of the mosque, I
won't pay that money." In other words: it'll never happen. But there are others like that, for example: "a
fly turning into an elephant", in other words: it'll never happen.
\tst Why do you think Jesus say's it's very difficult for rich people to get to the sky's kingdom?
\tsta RC: Because the truth is they want to have everything. A lot of everything. And these kind of people
with great difficulty give to those who are left, to the poor, and those without anything. And they arent
righteous enough to go to Gods kingdom. Because they think more about themselves than those close to
them or the poor.
\tsta ER: I don't think it's exactly like that, becaus I think anybody could. This man, even though he is rich,
it's not compulsory for him to become poor to enter the sky's kingdom. It's enough for him to help poor
people and to give money to those who don't have as much in order to enter the sky's kingdom. Not to
become poor. Of course he'll help a lot of people if he sells everything at once and gives it to them, but
it's the same to help regularly, for example by giving every week or every month money, clothes,
medicine, food. That can help too. (NP: So why do you think Jesus said this?) Because apparently it
used to be that way back then, many years ago.
\ln 79.13
\bt Then students ask Him: And who can be saved?
\anc mrk.10:26
\rtl1 And then Peter has asked: ìWho can be saved?î 
\rtl2 Then Peter has said to Jesus: ìThen who can come in the Godís kingdom?î 
\tst Who needs to be saved from what, do you think?
\tsta RC:  From these sins, like greed, evil, lies. People need to be saved from these sins and these negative
qualities.
\tsta ER: I don't know. (NP plays it again and asks: What do they mean?) They mean, if the rich can't enter
the sky's kingdom, who can then? In other words: all the other people. That the poor and the semi-rich
can enter the sky's kingdom, but not the rich. But why shouldn't they enter if they regularly help other
people? (NP: So if it's not possible for the rich...) Then not at all for the poor. But maybe they're
allowed into the sky's kingdom because all their lives they've lived in poverty and misery all their lives.
NR: But life shows that the rich always win. ER: Rich people always win the battle when it's against a
poorer person.
\ln 79.14
\bt Isus answers them that for a man thats impossible. It is possible only for the God.
\anc mrk.10:27
\rtl1 And Jesus says only the God but the people canít.
\rtl2 Jesus said that it will be the best only the young children to come in the Godís kingdom. 
\ln 79.15
\bt Then Peter tells Him that they have left everything and have followed Him.
\anc mrk.10:28
\tst What do you think it means to follow Jesus?
\tsta RC: To do everything he tells them to do. To give everything to him, to his teaching, to his mission. And
to help him.
\tsta NR: To believe in him unconditionally. To listen to him, to respect him.
\tsta ER: To do just like he does with all people.
\ln 79.16
\bt And Isus replies that He tells the true that there isnt a man who has left brothers, sisters,
mother, father, home because for the sake of (NP: Him and) gentle/ good things
\anc mrk.10:29
\co blagovestie (gentle/ good things): old Bulgarian word - must be changed
\co NP: We skipped this part for the second testing, because we decided to cut it. It is too confusing.
\tst Do you understand this?
\tsta RC: No.
\tst For what reason are people supposed to leave these things?
\tsta RC: To leave brothers, sisters and home... so to follow Jesus isnt at all easy. Because he is fulfilling a
mission which is really difficult, to teach people about what is good. And because of that they have
reject these things in order to follow his. And they themselves have to work out this mission, to help
those who are poorer, the poor. They have to sacrifice themselves and their families in order to help
others.
\ln 79.17
\bt and not to receive a hundred times more brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and a hundred times
more good things and together with it life forever.
\anc mrk.10:30
\co Backtranslator: bit about 100x more brothers etc. is confusing
\co Backtranslator: hardly understand the last sentence
\tst How can a person receive all of this do you think?
\tsta RC: Well the truth is it speaks of persecution. Because not everywhere will people receive their
teaching with good feelings. Some people will banish them. As for eternal life, what I said at the
beginning, its not about the person but the faith itself.

\co We might cut out the last bit seen as it is confusing.

\fix For next time you might have the BTers look at the transcription to check their backtranslation. 
\co Note:  Ideally it would have been better to have the bactranslations of the revised telling done by
someone other than Ante and Tomka (because they did the backtranslations of the original crafted story
and were used as testers for this story as well...therefore they had had exposure to the story making
their backtranslations of the revised telling maybe less than objective?  However, they were who we
had to work with and they both had learned how to backtranslate so hopefully they stuck with the format
of backtranslating they were taught.  It seems as if they did. 
\co Test 3 (using Rev telling):  with Oiope, April 17, 2009 (Note:  No retelling was given during this testing

\co I'm still working on the most efficient formatting for these files.  For now, the transcription of the
orally crafted story is broken up according to where Tomka broke it up during his backtranslation. 
Therefore, backtranslation 1 is lined up pretty tight (to the transcription).  However, KawÔre obviously
didnt break the story exactly like Tomka did during his backtranslation.  So I broke his backtranslation
up so that it would line up (as good as I could get it) with Tomka's backtranslation for comparison
reasons.  Having said that, I do think it would be profitable to see the transcription broken up
according to where KawÔre broke it up during his backtranslation.  Doing this would allow me to 'tightly'
line up his backtranslation with the transcription.  This would be good for langauge learning purposes.

happened after creation of the physical world.  
\cn what about doing a Creation story where God creates the Spirits/angels before he makes the world, and
you don't have any of them turning bad. Then you do your regular storyset except at the first explicit
instance of a demon or satan (I'm not counting the snake) you say "now you remember those angels that
God made, well some of them turned bad and the leader of the bad ones was one called Satan......and he
was in Zechariah's vision..." I really did like the way you did it in your Portuguese story though, do you
think the flashback is just not a storytelling device the bondo use?
\tst Which created thing do you think was/is most important to God?
\ans (Kay - Water and the animals that people could eat...without these things we wouldnt be alive today.) 
Oiope -  For me, I think this story is very interesting.  If he hadnt of created any plants, aves (or
arvores?), peixe, homem...where would we be?  If he hadnt of created us, we wouldnt exist.  If he hadnt
created food we would have died of hunger.  If he hadnt created water, then where would the fish
live...and they sustain us.  Your story is like our story.  Mas eu acho que voce n„o (46.33) Ele, but we did
[I'm not catching the Portuguese word here, but I'm pretty sure the essence of what he is saying is that
we 'brancos' didnt do something against Imere like they did].  Because of this He left us.  He created
lots of things for us to live, but we didnt like Him.  Tambem, when his dad killed his mom (speaking of
Imere's parents...I think)...foi embora e voltou pra cuidar nos, but instead of us liking him
(46.52-46.56?), but we mistreated him...we wanted to try and kill him...lots of things.  I guess you guys
did things against him too, but just a little.  (47.08-47.16? - he said something about him being here with
us...atÈ hoje?)  I dont think he liked this and because of this he left us...but he still likes us (?)...he's
helping us today, but I dont know why exactly...I guess he doesnt think about what we did to Him?  He
doesnt remember these things.  He likes us.  Today and moving forward we are liking Him again. 
(47.40-47.43?).  When he was with us we didnt like him.  Not you all, not us.  (47.49-47.51?)  I dont
know why we did this.  When he went to heaven we began missing him.  When we see things here on
earth that he created for us, we miss him.  (48.02-48.04?)  But up to today we like him and he helps us.  
\tst In what ways does He help you?
\ans When we ask something of him (he used the word oraÁ„o)...he helps us.  (48.28-48.35?)  Today he helps
us, but a long time ago, when we didnt like him...I dont know why we did things against him.  He had
returned to us.  He had helped us.  But when we told him to go away we began missing him (?)  I guess
we've both done things against him, but [he's definitely coming across with the idea that we've both
done things against God, but that we evidently didnt do it as bad]...because you all have airplanes,
imported things...you guys are more intelligent than us, we offended(?) him.  We think we would have
had these things to even we hadnt done the things we did against him.  [*Note:  It's interesting that he
continues this line of thinking from 52.10-54.30...in this he reflects on the Jesus film the Kelly chose
to show them seeming to equate Imere and Jesus...not in the sense that they are similar, but seeming to
talk as if they were the same person]

Ele chamou esses bichos so pra colocar o nome dele como Adao, 

ai chamarao ele como Adao, de Adao dizendo. Ai depois Ele chamou um monte de bicho ne, Ele chamou
os bichos so pra ser amigo desse Adao mais nenhum dos amigos dele mais ninguem combinou com ele. 

Ai Deus pensou, no que e que eu vou fazer quem e que vai ser companheiro desse homem ai Deus pensou
ne, ah Eu vou fazer Adao dormir ai entao Adao deitou e dormiu bem, bem muito mesmo ai e como Adao
tinha dormido bem profundo. 

Ai Deus foi la tirou costela dele, ai fez, tirou, cortou pedaco de costela, nao sei como Ele transformou
pedaco de costela em mulher, 

ai Adao acordou e viu essa mulher, ue da onde essa mulher veio, ai entao Adao falou agora eu vou me
casar com essa mulher, com ela que eu vou trabalhar nos vamos cuidar junto desses matos, bichos, aguas,
assim o Deus fez mulher pra Adao. 

Ai Deus ficou animado feliz com aqueles bichos que Ele tinha inventado, ai Ele falou quem que vai me
ajudar, ai entao Ele pensou eu vou fazer alguem pra me ajudar, ai Ele fez. 

Ai tudo, tudo aqueles que Deus fazia inventava Ele ficava feliz. Por causa deles ne Ele ficava feliz
aqueles bichos tambem gostava deles, tinha um representante daqueles bichos falou: ah, mentira desse
cara, mentira desse Deus, Ele quer ser dependente, Ele quer ficar deitado e agente fazendo coisa pra
Ele, disse esse representante dos bichos.

Ai um que era representante tava foi la pra os bichos falando que o Deus tava mentindo pra eles. Foi
assim outros bichos gostava de Deus mais um que era poderoso que nao gostava de Deus, ai o Deus tinha
escutado a fala do bicho que tinha falado mal Dele. 

Agora voces vao num lugar. Um lugar onde tem fogo que nao acaba, vao pra onde tem frio que nao
acaba, e a historia acabou assim.

\cn There's still a big question about what would be best to use for God.  When they hear 'Deus' they
immediately think of Imere.  The testing shows some differences between Imere and the God of the
Bible.  For example, he didn't always exist, he has a mom and dad (I think - and I think he killed his dad
too), and there are also some differences regarding things he created.  However, there are some basic
similarities as well...regarding things they created, the fact that he gives punishment, etc...  Ante
backtranslated Mactampo's telling of their Imere story.  This will be helpful in gathering more info
about their concept of Imere.  Also, in the recording of the testing session with Oiope, Ante recounted
(in Portuguese) some of the Imere story.  This was natural because this first story raises some
immediate barriers...not necessarily ngegative...just conflicting concepts between the God of the Bible
and Imere...which will be an inevitable issue if we stick with Imere as the key term for God.  1.01.35 -
1.10.15...here we had an interesting discussion regarding the 'just' nature of Imere.  For now, it seems
to me that their concept of Imere's character carries an attribute of justness.  He doesn't give
punishment to be mean, he gives punishment when it is deserved.

surprise that anchoring this section of the story is a challenge.  Honestly, from what we're giving him
(as far as sources go) he seems to be getting the idea of what's going on fairly well (conceptually). 
What's difficult, obviously, is putting a nice Bible verse next to each idea...which like I alluded to
earlier, is not necessarily easy even in English.  I did think our crafter had a good idea and he did it in
this revision.  He noticed that the spirits praised God when God was making things SO he wanted to put
their creation before the creation of the world.  He kept what happened to them at the end of the story
because to him it seemed like 'everyone was on board' during the creative process.  Made sense to me! 
I'm glad you're the consultant (ha).

\co I'm still working on the most efficient formatting for these files.  For now, the transcription of the
orally crafted story is broken up according to where Tomka broke it up during his backtranslation. 
Therefore, backtranslation 1 is lined up pretty tight (to the transcription).  However, KawÔre obviously
didnt break the story exactly like Tomka did during his backtranslation.  So I broke his backtranslation
up so that it would line up (as good as I could get it) with Tomka's backtranslation for comparison
reasons.  Having said that, I do think it would be profitable to see the transcription broken up
according to where KawÔre broke it up during his backtranslation.  Doing this would allow me to 'tightly'
line up his backtranslation with the transcription.  This would be good for langauge learning purposes.

main motive behind eve eating the fruit (and God forbidding it) is missing. Or almost 
missing, the snake talks about it in line 5.)

\cn Keep an eye on Nathans notes for this line.  We~re talking about genericizing the prophecy a little bit. 
Not trying to capatilize on the potential Messianic element but rather highlighting the fact that the
snake (who they will hopefully associate with Satan) gets beat in the end.   This is obvious and it is 
central to the redemptive theme.

\fix He made the only sense out of it that he could, that the snake was just a snake, so Eve's descendants
couldn't kill the snake himself, it would have to be the snake's descendants. A couple of things you could
do to help with this: 1) Say that the snake is Satan and anchor it with rev 12:9. 2) Say in the Spirit
world story that Satan tries to trick people and then make sure they use the same verb in this story when
Eve says "the snake tricked me". 3) Just make sure it's right in this story, and even if they don't
initially make the connection (like this guy) keep checking for it until they do....without you giving it
away of course. 
\fix Assuming option 3 gets eliminated, try option 2 next...which would have implications for the first

\anc Gen.03.16, Translator's Handbook says, I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing: this
is not in the form of a curse, as in the case of the snake, although the content has the effect
of a curse. Greatly multiply translates a Hebrew intensive construction: ‚ÄúI will very much
increase, make worse your pain.‚Äù Pain translates a word meaning ‚Äútrouble, difficulty, labor.‚Äù
Childbearing is literally ‚Äúconception.‚Äù The focus is not upon the act of conception but rather
upon the state of pregnancy, and so FRCL has ‚ÄúI will make your pregnancies painful,‚Äù and
TEV ‚Äú‚Ä¶increase your trouble in pregnancy.‚Äù

sozinho pra ele.  Ele tinha que trabalhar pra poder cuida dos filhos, alimentar os filhos...poder cuida das

que ele tinha poder de matar eles, ajudiar (not sure about this verb? - 18.11) deles...que ele era deus de

\ret Dai Elias falou "Agora voces vao ver, olham bem pra mim" Dai Elias foi la e se ajoelhou e comecou a
orar Dai Elias comecou a orar e falou "Oh Senhor meu Deus, quero que o Senhor mande o fogo pra mim,
assar meu carne que ta aqui, e queimar todas as lenhas que eu quero comer" o Elias falou isso.
\tst Who can ask for God's help like Elijah did on that day?
\ans Elias, Deus ensinou ele.  Quando Deus ensina gente (25.15-21? JW - He's saying something along the
lines that when God teaches someone to be a pajÈ that they become prepared to do that work like Elijah
was).  Elias fica assim como ele.  AtÈ hoje sÛ pajÈ can communicate with God like that...not just any person.

fish, calÁa (ou caÁa?) pra eles.  (28.33-36?) atÈ a gente viemos atÈ hoje.  Quando nÛs visita ele (28.38-45?)
voce vai descer l· no ch„o?  eu vou.  daÌ ele se ponta braÁo e eles descem.  Mas quando eles n„o quer...aÌ sua

\anc How would you approach this?
\cn Okay.  At times, I get concerned about how certain things aren't easily anchorable.  However, I'm
having to balance a few things in my mind (I'm asking for counsel here).  1.  These guys know nothing
about the Bible, they have no Scripture portions, and this is the first time they've heard any of this  2. 
I find myself continually asking, 'What is it that we're trying to communicate?'  So if there's not a
major theological or content discrepency, I'm finding myself to have more lenient tendencies than I did
before we started this process (just being honest).  3.  We're talking about conveying a panorama of
Redemptive History in 12-15 stories here, so it's impossible for us not to expect them to try and make
sense of some of the gaps in their own minds...in a way that's in keeping with their own storytelling
methods.

So my question...for instance, in the last two lines are we able to find nice anchors for this idea? 
Despite whether the answer is yes or no, isn't this essentially what we're trying to communicate when
we jump from the Fall to Elijah?  That essentially people went in one of two different
directions...following the One True God or that they began embracing false gods.  Feel free to rebuke
me (ha)!  I guess essentially I'm struggling with how much time to invest in correcting 'non-essentials'
that really don't affect the central message...and how much should I depend on the forthcoming written
translation to fill 'knowledge gaps' and to eventually provide a fuller understanding of the big picture?

1-4.  Lines 5-6 are somewhat grey, but in my opinion they get at the general idea of what happened? 
Lines 7-15 are kind of rough, huh?  Maybe we could go back and splice portions from the version we
revised?  Lines 16 to the end flow pretty good (I'm not saying there's not work to be done), but that
makes since because that's where the narrative actually flows in the Bible.  I'll be interested to hear
your thoughts on this one.  You won't hurt my feelings (ha).

Bondo name, but then they have a Portuguese 'nickname' that they go by when they are in town.

\t Hunsrik Exploratory Panorama Set Overview
\stg Bkgrnd (Hunsrik)
\co Hunsrik
\co Reason: Daniel and Stan see the following possibilities for redemptive themes among the Hunsrik:
Grace, Relationship, Forgiveness, Mediator, Messiah. We're leaning heavily to the Relationship and
Mediator themes initially. The other themes listed above will probably still apear as currents through the
exploratory panorama though they may not be fully developed in terms of Problem, Prediction, Jesus as
the Solution and Response.
\co We'll expand these descriptions in the days and weeks to come.
\co Story crafter's name or initials
\co Backtranslator's name or initials

\bld Story 1 -- Creation of the Spirit World
\co We're looking at separating the two creation stories based on length of telling. Consistently, all of our
house churches have asked questions about this and othe raspects of cosmology.
\cn God - creator of heaven

\bld Story 2 -- Creation of the Physical World
\co This story is the foundaiton for all we know about the relationship that God desires to have with man.
Also relavent to our people is the basis of the relationship between a husband and wife.
\cn God - creator of earth, Holy Spirit

\bld Story 3 -- The Fall of Mankind
\co This story shows the entrance of a need for a mediator between God and man and the broken
relationship between God and man. This story is actually the one that introduces the problem related to
relationship and mediator. We see here the seed form of the prediction of the Messiah.

\bld Story 4 -- Covenant with Israel & 10 Commandments
\co This story shows God entering into a relationship with Israel in order to have a relationship with the
other nations. Israel becomes a nation-priest, a mediating nation, between God and the other nations.
The 10 Commandments will provide a corrective to the Catholic catechism exclusion of having no
"graven images."

\bld Story 5 -- Golden Calf
\co  This story shows Moses as mediator between God and Israel. This story also addresses the issue of
idolatry, praying to the saints, among our people.

\bld Story 6 -- David and Bathsheba w/ Nathan and David
\co This story shows broken relationships on many levels of society and with God. Nathan's visit may be
incuded with this story as well. God sends a prophet who is something as a  mediator.

\bld Story 7 -- Nathan and David w/ Death of the Child and Psalm 51
\co This story will either start with Nathan's visit or the death of the child, depending on how the previous
story is crafted. We believe the Psalm is vital to show repentence. This story will address the idea of
original sin that we discovered in Porto Velho about mother's milk passing sin to the child.
\cn Forgiveness of sins

\cn It appears that we have left out the "prediction" story, aside from the story of the Fall which is very
general. We are now aware of this possible gap and will be considering stories to use for this purpose.
We'll let you know when we decide a story that meets this need in the story set.

\bld Story 8 -- The Birth of Jesus
\co You can't have a redemptive set without this story. There's no way to understand Jesus without his
birth. We may also use this in some way to counter the original sin issue and mother's milk. We'll see.
\cn Jesus the Son, the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary and forgiveness of sins

\bld Story 9 -- John the Baptist and Jesus' Baptism
\co John's proclamation was repentence for forgiveness of sin - restoration of relationship, and making
straight the path for the Messiah. Jesus' baptism deals with one aspect of the baptism barrier we face
among our people.

\bld Story 10 -- Parable of the Unjust Servant
\co This story deals with relationship and forgiveness. It is one that has struck a bell with our people in
past studies.

\bld Story 11 -- Parable of the Wedding Feast
\co This story deals with relationship, heaven, and forgiveness.

\bld Story 12 -- Parable of the Prodigal Son
\co This story deals with relationship and forgiveness. It also has struck a bell with our people in the past.
Here we see God as Father.
\cn God the Father

\bld Story 13 -- Crucifixion
\co This story shows Jesus as mediator and the one who pays the price to restore the relationship that God
desires to have with us. This one will probably end up being 2-3 stories in order to show the arrest/trial
and crucifixion.
\cn suffered under Pilate, crucified, died and buried

\bld Story 14 -- Resurrection
\co Without this there is no Christianity, regardless of theme choice.
\cn Raised on the third day and ascended into heaven and seated at the right hand of the Father

\bld Story 15 -- Peter's Proclamation (Acts 2)
\co This story may be used in conjunction with Acts 1 in two stories. This will introduce the holy spirit, the
church, and the Lord's supper and baptism after repentence.
\cn Jesus is Lord, church, communion of the saints

\cn After a once-over from the Creed, it seems we need to have a clearer picture of the bodily resurrection
from the dead and the return of Christ to judge the living and the dead. We'll be looking more closely at
these possible gaps in the exploratory set.

\cn Below is where we will expand the exploratory set for our overall, longer set.

\anc Gen.03:15-17
\cn 2nd time through the Tree of Knowledge was corrected. Culture: The fact that God planned for Adam to
care for the land and plant crops is important to this agriculturally-based society. This was shown by
how easily the command given to Adam to care for the Garden of Eden was picked up during testing.
Today, the government's enviromental agencies as well as private ones are making agricultural life
difficult. The are more incentives for people to return their lands to forest than to plant them with
crops. The larger Urban culture, among the more educated, do not value the agricultral industry and
view it as destroying the nature beauty. However this passage is useful in combating an unbiblical view
that the elite, in many Western nations are touting.

probably answered this question correctly....Also, may have been intimidated with the ladies present.
\anc Gen.03:24
\cn Today, the younger generations of the Hunsrik and even some older are not respectful of the bond that
God intends between a man and woman. While Catholics do not officially receive divorces many of
them live separated form their husbands and wives but with another partner creating children outside
the bonds of marriage. They prefer this and accept it over leaving the Catholic Church. The government
grants divorce but most do not seek it because they still recognize the authority of the Catholic Church
in regard to marriage. Younger Hunsrik most often live together for 5-10 years before officially
marrying in the Catholic Church. This in hopes of avoiding an official separation.

\ln 05.14
\bt1 Eles eram n˙s e n„o tinham vergonha.

\eng The two were nude but they were not ashamed of each other.
\tst1 Q: Por que o homen e a mulher n„o tinham vergonha para estar nu? A: Pura, pureza. Depois comeram a
fruta e envergonhou.
\anc Gen.03:25
\cn Among the Hunsrik this is significant because their tranditional view of marital relations is that it is
based in sin, i.e. marital, 'sexual', relations are sinful. In Hunsrik the word for 'sexual relations'
literally translates into English as 'the bads.' This comes from their understanding of their Catholic
heritage which teaches that 'sex' is sinful. A generation or two ago brides would be given a nuptial lace
clothe that was to cover or veil the brides entire body on her wedding night so as to cover her 'shame.'
The only opening was over the genital area. While this view is changing today among secularizing
forces it still remains an important aspect of culture and needs to be dealt with. Among the older
generation this view is quite strong still and any public display of affection is viewed with disdain.
Naturally in our Brazilian Latin American context where public display of affection is demonstrated, if
not outright flaunted, their is a conflict between cultural worldviews. Dealing with this also will set the
stage for showing that it is not sinful for those called to ministry to marry.

\olden Jesus was born like this.
\anc Mat.01:18
\bt2 Passaram muitos anos e Deus mandaou o Salvador que prometeu e assim fui. 
\eng Many years passed and God sent the Savior that He promised and this is how it happened.
\tst1 Q: What does the word (Reter) mean? A:Savior 

\ln 201.02
\cn I asked for the Portugues equivalent to verify I had the correct word.
\old Maria estava com Jos√©. Ela se viu gravida do √âspirito Santo.
\olden Mary was with Joseph. She became pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
\bt2 JosÈ e Maria foram prometidos um para ou outro. Mas Maria estava esperando um filho do EspÌrito
Santo.  
\eng Joseph and Mary were promised to each other. But Mary was expecting a child (son) of the Holy
Spirit.
\tst1 Q: What does the word 'ferxproch' (spoken for) mean? A:Promised, Spoken for...
\anc Mat.01:18
\cn This word 'ferxproch' is the word for promised. When it is used it is as good as done. This was the
undoubtedly the word the Hunsrik used when contracts were oral and not written. They explained that it
is used not only in engagement but also when dealing with good or animals, land, etc. Their
understanding was right on here.

\ln 201.03
\old Jos√© sempre era um homem correto. 
\olden Joseph was always a right man.
\bt2 E daÌ JosÈ quis deixar Maria em sagredo.
\eng So Joseph wanted to leave Mary in secret.
\anc Mat.01:19
\cn This sentence would be better to come after the fact that Joseph wanted to abandon her. Just seems cut
and pasted here. will revise.

\ln 201.04
\old Jos√© no mesmo momento queria abandonar a Maria mas e um anjo veio em sonho e disse,
"Jos√©, filho de Dav√≠, ele n√£o tinha medo de abandonar a Maria. O filho que ela est√°
esperando √© do √àspirito Santo e ela dar a luz e voc√™s v√£o dar a nome de Deus a ele. Ele
vai salvar as pessoas dos pecados."
\olden Joseph, at that same moment, wanted to leave Mary but an angel came in a dream and said, "Joseph, son
of David, he didn't have any fear of leaving Mary. The child that she is waiting for is from the Holy
Spirit and she will give birth and you (ya'll) will give the name of God to him. He will save the people
from sins."
\bt2 Ele n„o quis falar mau da Maria. Mas quando JosÈ estava dormindo veio um anjo e falou para JosÈ, " JosÈ,
Filho de DavÌ, n„o precisa ter medo para casar com Maria. Pois ela vai ter um filho do EspÌrito Santo e
vocÍ vai chama-lo de Jesus Cristo. Ele vai salvar o povo de todos os pecados deles. 
\eng He didn't want to speak ill of Mary. But when Joseph was sleeping and angel came and said to
Joseph, "Joseph, Son of David, you don't need to be afraid to marry Mary. She will have a child
(son) of the Holy Spirit and you will name him Jesus Christ. He will save the people from all of
their sins.
\tst1 Q:Why did the angel speak with Joseph?  A:They did not get this question. I should asked what the
angel had said. There are several references to angels delivering messages and that may have
contributed to the confusion.
\anc Mat.01:20
\cn See L&C Notes: √âspirito Santo.
\fix Obviously there is a problem in Angels delcaration to Joseph as it switches to past tense. We will
correct this in the future. Also, he said that Joseph was not afraid of abandoning Mary which is not
true to the story.

\ln 201.05
\old Jos√© casou com Maria e deu o nome de Deus a Ele. Jos√© n√£o teve rela√ß√µes com Maria antes
que Jesus nasceu.
\olden Joseph married Mary and gave the name of God to Him. Joseph didn't have relations with Mary before
Jesus was born.
\bt2 E JosÈ fui obediente e fez o que o anjo pediu. E n„o dormiu com Maria atÈ que Maria tivesse o filho.
Quando o filho nasceu JosÈ chamou-o Jesus.
\eng And Joseph was obedient and did waht the angel asked. And he didn't sleep with Mary until
Mary had a son. When the son was born Joseph named him Jesus
\anc Mat.01:24 -25

\ln 201.06
\old Jesus nasceu na cidade de Beleem.
\olden Jesus was born in the city of Bethlehem
\bt2 Ele nasceu em Belem. 
\eng He was born in Bethleham.
\tst1 Q:What is Bethlehem? A: The birthplace of Jesus.
\anc Mat.02:01
\cn This city as Jesus' birthplace was easily recognized. The city is not known as the City of David, Ruth's
adopted town, etc. This is an area that is important as the prophets unfold the comin of the Christ in the
OT.

\ln 201.07
\old Um pouco alguns homems estavam estudando as estrelhas. 
\olden After a little bit some men were studying the stars.
\bt2 Naqueles tempos Herodes era o rei de Israel. Veio homens do Oriente que estudavam as estrelas. 
\eng In those times Herod was the king of Israel. Some men came from the East (Orient) who
studied the stars.
\cn I honestly think it was the first time they had ever thought about these men studying the stars. I
deliberately left out the bringing of presents to focus on their worship of Jesus. 
\tst1 Was macht te mener fon te Orient? Farom hot te mener en pesuchen kemacht? A: They did not get that
these men studied stars.

\bt2 E eles viram uma estrela grande. DaÌ eles foram l· no Herodes e pediram, "Onde est· o Rei dos Judeus?" 
\eng And they saw a big star. So they went there to Herod and asked, "Where is the King of the
Jews?"
\tst1 Q: Why did the men from the Orient go and speak with Herod? A: The did not fully understand this but
it was an abstract idea presented. I was simply looking to see if they understood they had come seeking
the Christ. My additional questions did show that they understood this aspect. 
\anc Mat.02:02

\ln 201.09
\old Herodes viu isto da√≠ ficou muito preocupado. 
\olden Herod saw this  and from there became very concerned.
\bt2 Herodes se assuto e ficou preocupado. 
\eng Herod became scared and was worried.
\tst1 Q: Why was Herod so upset as this news? A: Because he was king and was afraid of losing his power.

\bt N√≥s vimos a estrela e gostamos dela.
\eng We saw a star and we liked it.
\anc Mat.02:02
\cn In bt2 this part of the story was told earlier and in much more timely place. Also corrected this potion
as well. 
\fix Clearly this needs to be corrected in regard to why the visitors from the East came. They came to
worship/adore him and not simply to ¥like¥ him.

\ln 201.11
\old E da√≠ Herodes fiz os l√≠deres da religi√£o e pediu a onde que nasceu este Rei dos Judeus?
\olden And from there Herod made the leaders of the religion and asked where this King of the Jews was born?
\bt2 Pegou os supremos da religi„o e pediu a onde nasceu o Rei dos Judeus. 
\eng He got the highest people in the religion and asked where the King of the Jews was born.
\tst1 Q: What did Herod ask of the relgious leaders? A: Where is the king?
\anc Mat.02:04
\cn Unclear... no mention of meeting that Herod demanded.

\olden From there they responded, "In the city of Bethlehem. They have recieved a prophet"
\bt2 AÌ eles falaram, "Em Betel. O profeta escreveu isso."
\eng And they said, "In Bethlehem. The profet wrote that."
\tst1 Q: What did the religious leaders tell him? A: They did not get the question...did not have an answer so
I pressed on.
\anc Mat.02:05
\fix No mention of the prophets who announced this. Seems the man thought the religious leaders were
stating this of their own accord (no Scriptural backing). It is confusing as it is and will be corrected.
\cn in bt2 the fix was corrected. 

\ln 201.13
\old E da√≠, Herodes urgentemente se reuniu com aqueles que vierem. Da√≠ ele pediu quando que
a estrela veio? Da√≠ eles falarem. 
\olden And from there, Herod met ungently with those who came. >From there he asked when the star
appeared? From there they said.
\cn This portion was not in 2nd crafted version. It was not deemed vital to the understanding of the story.
\anc Mat.02:07
\cn Needs to note that the meeting was in SECRET. Points to his underhandedness.

\ln 201.14
\old Ele mandou eles para Beleem. "V√£o pedir a onde que esta este menino. Da√≠ voc√™s voltam
para que eu posso gostar dele."
\olden He sent them to Bethlehem. "Go ask where this boy is. From there you (ya'll) return so that I can like
(enjoy) him."
\bt2 AÌ falou Herodes para os homens do Oriente. VocÍs podem atÈ Betel e dopois era para voltar para falar a
onde que ele nasceu que ele tambÈm queria visita-la. 
\eng And Herod said to the men from the East. You may go to Bethlehem and then return to tell me
where he was born because he also wanted to visit him.
\anc Mat.02:08
\cn Needs some attention to how they will find out where Jesus is. 
\fix Also, Herod said that he wanted to worship/adore. I need to find out if they have a work for adore,
worship which is more than ¥like¥ as it keeps recurring. Perhaps this is a word not known or it is
intentional as worship of Mary is intense...Will field test.. (He was consistent with this word
throughout...perhaps there is no other word...needs to be tested.

\ln 201.15
\bt No caminho eles viram de novo a estrela dele. Da√≠ at√© l√° na casa onde que ¬¥tava o menino e eles
gostavam dele.
\eng On the path they again saw his star. From there to beyond there where the house where the
boy was and they like him. 
\anc Mat.02:09
\cn Not deemed as vital to the telling of the story so this was not included. This star is still presented when
the travellers from the Orient speak with Herod about the Kinf of the Jews.
\fix Noted above...came to worship/adore. Here he uses the past tense ¥they liked him.¥

\ln 201.16
\old Com muito alegre eles entrarem dentro da casa e se ajoelharem em frente dele e
gostarem dele.
\olden With much joy they went inside the house and knelt in front of him and liked him.
\bt2 Os homens ficaram bestante contentes quando acharam a crianÁa. Se ajoelharam na frente dele e o
elogiaram. 
\eng The men were very happy when they reached the baby. They kneeled in front of him and
praised him.
\tst1 Q: What did the men from the Orient do when they found the Christ-child? A: They worshipped Jesus
and Mary too.
\anc
\cn This was the most problematic area that I encountered. The story specifically states that the men from
the East went and worshipped the baby Jesus. Those tested automatically viewed the visit as involving
the worship of Mary. One person spoke up but no one disputed what was said. Definitely confirming
what we have found and that is...The worship of Mary is key to breaking Folk Catholicism.
\old Da√≠, eles derem presentes de ouro. 
\olden And then, they gave presents of gold.
\anc Mat.02:11
\cn in bt2 they did not place the presents in the story as I left it out of the crafted version in order to
focus upon their worship of Jesus which is very import if we are to lead them toward a salvation in
Jesus alone understanding. I did not feel that the gifts were the essential here. Most already know that
they brought grifts and not needed for clearer understanding. So, no fix was necesaary. 
\fix Offered more than just gold. Will be corrected.

\ln 201.18
\old Deus aviso que n√£o era para vim de volta porque Herodes estava esperando eles.
\olden God advised that it wouldn't do to return because Herod was waiting for them.
\bt2 Quando estavam dormindo veio um anjo e falaram, "N„o voltaram para Herodes para falar a onde que ele
nasceu." E os homens foram obedientes. 
\eng When they were sleeping an angel cam and said, "Don't return to Herod to tell him where He
was born." And the men were obedient.
\tst1 Q: Farom hot te mÎner nÎt tsu Herootes tsurik kekang? A: Herod wanted to kill Jesus.

\old Quando Jos√© estava dormindo um anjo do c√©u veio e o anjo disse, "Foge com o menino.
Foge para o Eg√≠to porque Herodes quer matar ele." Jos√© obedeceu.
\olden When Joseph was sleeping and angel of heaven came and the angel says, "Flee with the boy. Flee to
Egypt because Herod wants to kill him." Joseph obeyed.
\bt2 Depois quando JosÈ estava dormindo veio um anjo e falou que JosÈ era para fugir para Egito porque
Herodes queria matar Jesus. 
\eng Then when Joseph was sleeping an angel came and said that Joseph should flee to Egypt
because Herod wanted to kill Jesus.
\tst1 Q: Where did the angel tell Joseph to go with the child and his mother?  A: Did not know. Difficulty
explained below.
\anc Mat.02:13, 14
\cn Needs a transition phrase here such as...a little time later...afterwards.... Names of cities cause
difficulty. Some are Portuguese and some are in Hunsrik. Here Egypt caused problems. They
recognized the Portuguese name and not the Germanic. The translation team has battled with this for
some time. Proper names have almost exclusively become Portuguese for people and places. The Hunsrik
live quite well with this dicotomy and it shows in their names....ex: Pedro Schmidt, Joao Hemmer, etc.  

\ln 201.20
\old Herodes viu que era enganado. Da√≠ ele avisou que era para matar todo menor a baixo de
dois anos em Beleem.
\olden Herod saw that he was tricked. Then he advised that it should be done that everyone under two years in
Bethleham should be killed.
\bt2 Mas os homens da Oriente n„o voltaram e Herodes ficou furiouso porque ele n„o sabia quem era Jesus. AÌ
ele ordinou aos servos deles a matar todos as crianÁas de baixo de dois anos. 
\eng So the men from the East didn't return and Herod was furious because he didn't know who
Jesus was. He ordered his servants to kill all the children under two years.
\tst1 Q: Why did Herod want to kill the Christ-child? A: Fear of him.   Q: Why was Herod furious? A: I did
not get the answer I was looking for. Person meandered... 
\anc Mat.02:16
\cn Needs to show in the story that Herods orders were carried out. 

\ln 201.21
\old Quando Herodes morreu o anjo disse a Jos√©, "Pega a mai e o menino e vai para Israel. "
\olden When Herod died an angel said to Joseph, "Get the mother and the boy and go to Israel."
\bt2 Quando morreu Herodes veio um anjo para JosÈ e disse, "Pode voltar para Israel com sua espousa e teu
filho." 
\eng When Herod died an angel came to Joseph and said, "You can return to Israel with your wife
and your son."
\cn In this story I think that the way that Matthew was led by the Holy Spirit to address Jesus and Mary as
'the boy and his mother' is important. The angel stated it in this manner both times he appeared to
Joseph. I am thinking that this will need to be changed here when Joseph is told to return to Israel and
above when he is told to take 'the boy and his mother' and flee to Egypt. Our crafter used 'family' the
first time and the second 'your wife and child' the second. If Matthew refered two times in the same
manner I think, especially in our Catholic and ever growing secular context that this is highly important
because it places the child Jesus before his mother and does not refer to Joseph as the father. Yet,
leaves him with the responsibility of caring for them. It appears to be done in this manner to reiterate
the miraculous birth.
\anc Mat.02:19, 20

\ln 201.22
\old E Jos√© obedeceu.
\olden And Joseph obeyed.
\bt2 JosÈ fui obediente e fez tudo que o anjo pediu.

\tst1 Q: What is Galilee?  A:The place where Jesus taught. Q: What does the word BAPTIZE mean? A: To
repent of your sins.  Q:When should a person be baptized?  A: When he has a mind to understand. Being
baptized as a child does nothing. You must be an adult.
\anc mat.03:13
\cn The issue of baptism, i.e. infant baptism, is huge in the Hunsrik culture. They are taught that without
baptism of the baby salvation is not possible. While more and more fall away from this it is often
difficult for parents to stand against the culture when grandparents and other family members
pressure. But this knowledge is a BIG first step. We will be including many stories showing adult
baptism.

because of other bad things that he had already done.
\tst1 Q: What did John say to the ruler Herod that made him mad? A: You have taken your brothers wife as
your own.  Q: Was John correct in what he said to Herod the rule? Why?  A: Yes, Herod acted
immorality.

\cn The testee did not know what a Pharisee was. The story does not describe what a Pharisee is or believed
so it is one aspect that we will have to include in the earlier stories regarding the life of Jesus. She
also called him Simon Peter several times so I think that knowing this name (supposed founder of the
Catholic Church) also played a part. Nothing more than to point out that these distincitons/groups will
need to be explained earlie.

\tst1 Q: Wii Yeesus hot tas fraa sayn sinte ferstayert? A: Because she showed Jesus  by what she did that
she was a good person so he forgave her. 
\cn Clearly we did not address the scope and breath of Jesus' authority to forgive sins but for this one
story it certainly highlighted repentance even though her answer did not use this word it hit all alround
it. What needs to be done is to include stories as we go along showing the authority of Jesus Christ.
Cures, casting out demons, calming the storm will help. Also, stories where Jesus is attributed to be more
than a man by the demons that encounter him would also help. I don't see one story solving this issue.
However, I am very pleased that the essence of repentance was understood.

\cn Demon possession is a part of the culture. They have the EVIL EYE and various other supersticians as
well. However, the Hunsrik are secularizing so it is not uncommon to find individuals scoffing at demon
possession. The back translator of this story thought I should leave the possession part of the story out
because she did not like it implying that she has her doubts about it. Adding other stories of demons and
also the Devil will be important in the future.

\cn The Lord's Supper for most means anything but a remembrance. The back translator shared that, in her
understanding, the Lord's Supper is GRACE (Consistent with Catholic teaching). She separates
FORGIVENESS though saying that forgiveness comes at the beginning of the mass and then grace at
the end when the cracker dipped in the wine is eatten. I have never looked at grace and forgiveness as
totally separate. Certainly, stories where grace is demonstrated to individuals or groups of individuals
will be important. Especially those that focus upon heart rather than ritual. This should be both in the
OT and NT because the Catholic ritual system is very OT in many ways.

\c K-00
\t K'bou Story Set, etc.
\stg Bkgrnd (K'bou)
\co <Redemptive theme> Trusting God vs. Trusting Self  Trusting God for all things, including our salvation.
[Subpoints: God's Plan of Salvation, Jesus is Lord; (Master/Submission)]
\co <Purpose> To help the K'bou see salvation is the completed work of God and they need to trust (and obey)
the Way He already made. To help the K'bou see that following after money is a trap of Satan to keep
them from following God.
\co <Background> Jacob exemplifies the mentality of being too self oriented and too busy for God that the
Kb culture seems to exhibit. We hope that once we are able to make the story clear enough, that people
will be interested in this character that gets the best of others (they love that in their fables.) They
have a typical Muslim worldview; they believe in One God to whom they are slaves; salvation is earned
by good works - they hope.  Lying is a way of life, so K'bou are not trust-worthy and don't trust each
other. They don't trust God to meet their needs; they think success must be their own doing. Money
dominates their WHOLE THINKING and worldview. They all try to take advantage of each other and to
avoid being taken advantage of by others.
\co <Basic Biblical concepts>  God is the Supreme Authority and expects our obedience. God is completely
trust-worthy; man is seldom trustworthy. God is always trying to get man to trust Him. Jacob wouldn't
submit to God, so God had to break him of his self-sufficiency.  God expects us to trust Him rather than
manipulate situations for our own benefit.  God is always true to His word; His sovereign plan for our
salvation will be fulfilled.
\co <Cohesion>  The Blessings of God are many and manifold, but ultimately, they are fulfilled in Christ. 
God is seeking out man.
\co <Other thoughts>  God's plan included blessing the world (incl. Kbs) through Abraham's descendents, so
God promised to bless Jacob. Jacob lived without feeling blessed by God's Blessing.  K'bou are too hard
at work trying to "bless" themselves, to know God's blessing. We feel God's blessing when we are in
close relationship to Him. Complete Blessing of God found in Christ. 

\old <Back Translation> We recorded the story on a cassette tape and had the BT listen twice
and then he gave a bt sentence by sentence as we recorded the process on another
recorder. Then I typed out what the BT said in French and from that, translated it to
English. 
\co <Back Translation> We record the story in an audio file and play it off the computer. The BT listens
twice - or more. The translation is then made sentence by sentence with the translation being written
down. It was much too confusing to transcript a recording that went back and forth on sentence
comprehension and then knowing whether sentences were repeated or only said once in the original.
The level of French is generally not good enough to get a faithful translation on any sentences that go
"outside their box." From the written French translation, I translate it into English.
\co <List of potential stories> Please see the Excel file we made for this purpose
\co <Resources for crafting> Almost nothing for Kanembou. We got some script preparation videos. We
have a set of pictures on our computer, but we haven't found them that helpful. Life here is about like
life in Jesus's day, so there is less need for cultural pictures. Story boarding seems to help the most.
There is no Bible translated in K'bou. Some stories (Bible passages) have been translated by a former
missionary, but he did not do Jacob. The FranÁais Courant Bible (French easy language Bible).

\old <Two testing groups> For our first story, we just asked two people to answer our testing
questions; one is a younger man, with a little primary school education; and one is a
middle-aged woman who hasn't attended school. We don't know if they will be available for
future testing.
\co <Two testing groups> MHW has some friends he wants us to test with. Have to find another group too.
We'll have to tell about them before each story.
\old <Crafter> Our Crafter, "Aboriginal," is a middle-aged man who has not had much schooling.
He has taught himself oral French but his level is not too high. He loves to laugh and seems
to like to tell stories informally. 
\co <Crafter> Our main crafter now, MHW, is a young man in his 20s. He has been extremely faithful to
come help us. He is even willing to help us without pay (which is a work of God, although we do give him
some help every week -about $10 - so that he doesn't have to leave us to find a job in order to be able to
eat.)
\old <Back Translator> "Abdellahi" is a high school student probably in his early twenties. His
French level is not that great, but probably typical of what we will find here. There are men,
who have better levels, but we are still looking for someone better. (Since our helpers may
change from story to story for now, we would rather give this information in the top lines of
each story.) 
\co <Back Translator> We have had a string of them. We will let you know story by story.

\bt Redemptive Theme
\co Our redemptive theme is relationships with forgiveness as a sub-theme. (Mbuthia) 
\co The Tharaka people value relationships very much. To them every elder is either a father or a mother
and they so often call one another brother. They really respect their family lines and clans such that
there are clans that one is allowed to marry from and those that do not trade with the other. The theme
on relationship would help strengthen what they already have and also insist on the Importance of
relating well with people outside their clans. Jesus came to reconcile / restore the broken relationship
between God and man. Forgiveness is the tool that God used to restore this broken relationship when he
send his son to die for the sin of all mankind.

blessings are tangible.

\rtl2 And God blessed Him With wealth.
\cn The Tharaka word used for wealth is the same one used for things and properties. The backtranslator
