\con SH2 = 12 Aug 2009 -- I have answered your questions below.  Also, when you respond to
the Consultant Notes, please send both the ConNotes file and the BT file.  This will help
me to see what changes you have made in the BT file.
\fac MH1: 24 July 2009  
\con SH1 = 15 June 2009 -- Good job with this story!  I like how it is simple and not full of
many details.

\con SH1:  Below you will see four categories listed (anchors, testing questions, key terms,
and retellings).  These are the four main areas that I am checking for when I consult
your stories.  Sometimes I may make general comments about that area in your story at
the top of the consulting notes.  Other times, all the comments will be listed below and will
correspond to the specific line number in the story.

\co ANCHORS:
\co TESTING Qs:  As part of your ongoing training, I have written some testing questions
for this story.  Please write testing questions for stories 3, 4 & 5 and put them into your
story file.  Then send me the story files and I will review your questions.  
\co KEYTERMS:  
\co RETELLINGS:  As part of the testing process, you will need to get recordings of two
people retelling the story.  These recordings should then be backtranslated into English. 
Then put the  backtranslations into the story file in Toolbox.  You can backtranslate
these retellings yourself.  As I check the story, I will be looking to see how well people
are retelling the story and what changes they are making.  I have added some lines to the
story file so you can see where the retellings will need to be inserted.  This requirement
for documenting the retellings has been added recently in OneStory.  I am not sure if
this was included in your CLS training.  If you have any questions about this, please let
me know.

\con SH1:  Please provide the following information about your crafter, backtranslator,
testees, and retellers:  name (you can also use initials or a nickname  instead of their real
name), education level, approximate age, gender, religious background,
believer/non-believer, etc.   This can be included in chapter 00 with the story set
information.  Once you add this information, please send me a new copy of that file.
\fac MH1:I did but still it is on the way. It will be finishing next week.

\con SH1:  Your project is still in Stage 1 consulting.  This means that many of my comments
will focus on continuing the training you've received.  My goal at this stage is to help
mentor you as you craft, back translate, and test these stories.  I want you to know that
in Stage 1 consulting, I will not make comments about everything in a story that may need
to be adjusted.   We try to only make comments on about half the number of lines in a
Stage 1 story so that facilitators don't get overwhelmed. Some comments may wait until
you reach Stage 2 consulting which is more in-depth.
\fac MH1:I sent a copy of chapter00 through email  

\con SH1:  In your emails, you mentioned that you have been crafting the stories first into
Lao and that you are also working on stories in TDG.  So are these backtranslations from
a Lao story or TDG story?  If they are from Lao, then we should change the language
name in the file. 
\fac MH1:Yes, I changed name of language.

\con SH1:  If an anchor includes verses that follow each other, you can type them as
Gen.01:01 -02.  Just be sure to include a space between the verses numbers.  This will
save you time so that you don't have to type a separate anchor for each verse.
\fac MH1:I changed it.

\con SH1:  re: "The creator has all power"  -- Please include an anchor for this line.

\con SH1:  re: "After then, He created the fish in the river" -- In line 01.06, the story already
says that God created all living things.  Would fish be included in "all living things"? 
What was reason to specifically mention fish but not mention any other animals by name?
\fac MH1: L people might think living things are animals in the earth. Also God made
vegetation, wild animals, cattle on 3rd & 6th day. But God made fish on 5th day.
\fac MH1: May I change 01:06 into detail things?
\con SH2:  Do you mean that you want to say the specific categories, such as animals, fish,
vegetation?  Since you are not mentioning the days of creation, it is fine to include all
of these things in one line of the story.  You could add these details to line 01:06 and
remove line 01:08 from the story.

\ln 01.09
\ln 01.10
\con SH1:  re: "dust of the earth" -- It would be good to test what people understand by this
term.  We want to check whether people think that this type of dust can be gathered
together to form an image.  There may be different words that can be translated as
'dust.'  We want to use a word that is similar to the English words 'mud' or 'soil.'  These
forms of dirt are more wet and can hold together to be molded into an image.  I have
written a testing question for this in the story file.
\fac MH1:In L term dust means mud.
\con SH2:  Please add your above note to the BT file as a crafting note.  The crafting note
line should follow the anchor line.  It would look like this:   \cn  In L term dust means mud.

\ln 01.11
\con SH1:  re: "in the garden" -- The story has not mentioned yet that there is a garden.  You
may want to add that God created a garden for the man to live in.

\ln 01.18
\con SH1:  re: "and they also loved God" -- Do you have an anchor to support this line?
\fac MH1: May I put more anchors? Gen.01:31, Gen.02:07 -08, Gen.02:15 -18, Gen. 02:20-22 
\con SH2:  I don't think these anchors give enough Biblical support to say directly that they
loved God.  I think this is an interpretation of the text.  I think it would be better to say
something like:  "they had a good relationship with God".  We know this is true because
in Gen.03:09 it shows that God would walk with them in the garden.

\ln 02.01
\con SH1:  re: "They lived..." -- If the listener does not hear this story immediately after the
first story, they may be confused about who 'they' are.  I recommend making this line
clearer by saying specifically 'the man and woman' or 'the first man and woman that God
had created.'

\con SH1:  re: "they lived with God happily in the garden" -- The backtranslation implies that
God was also living in the garden with them.  However, the text does not support this
idea.  We know that God would come and walk in the garden with them.  But it does not
say that God actually lived in the garden.

\con SH1:  re:  "then she took it and gave her husband, they ate the fruit" -- It would be good
to test this line.  You want to test whether people understand that Adam knew it was the
forbidden fruit or not.  If people think that Eve tricked him or he was unaware he was
disobeying, you may want to add to the story the part from Gen.03:06 that says that
Adam was there with her.

including this?

\con SH1:  re:  "God call out to the man and asked, "Where are you?" -- It would be good to

this.

\con SH1:  re: "You are cursed" -- It is important to test the meaning of the word 'curse'.  Are
there different words in Lao that are used for curse?  Is it appropriate for God to curse
someone?

\con SH1:  re: "eat dust" -- You will need to test that people understand that the snake will not
literally eat dust for its food.  See this note from Translator's Handbook (TH):  "The
second consequence, and dust you shall eat, does not necessarily mean that the snake will
live on dust, or eat nothing but dust for its food, but rather that as a crawling animal its
mouth will be near the ground, and its food will be dusty."

story?  It would be good to use the same word so there is consistency between the two
stories.

resources as well (e.g. the Genesis film, the picture Bible, and picture story boarding)?
\co See common on 02.11
\co Seeing the very literal back-translation you made was useful and interesting, but if
possible could you also include a free translation so that we can more easily understand
who did what to whom. (like you did in 02.09).

\ln 02.01
\ln 02.02
\ln 02.03
\co as you suspect from the anchor, this rendering of the question by the snake is
misleading, who was clearly challenging God (see \cn in BT file). Do you have any good
"trickster" stories in your collection that might suggest a good way to imply his being
crafty?
\ln 02.04
\co be sure the background information here (i.e. what tree in the center, etc) is in the
earlier creation story so that this reference here make sense. We've included a number
of possible testing questions from which you can choose what you think will be
interesting... roughly 1 question for every 2-3 lines.
\ln 02.05
\ln 02.06
\co Is it clear from the passive form of this verse who's doing what the giving?
\ln 02.07
\co So that the following question might make more sense, it might be good to include also
here that "they were hiding". And then include a testing question like, "Why do you think
they hid?"
\co I know that you used Word to edit this story, but in Toolbox for the the anchor to be able
to jump properly to the NetBible, you need to add a '0' to pad the verse number.
\ln 02.08
\ln 02.09
\co The rendering here is probably fine (i.e. unpacking the rhetorical question). gen.03:09
would also work to anchor this verse. See also the \cn line in the BT file.
\ln 02.10
\co The rendering here is very indirect (as if the agent of his being "ordered" is unknown).
Is there some (discourse?) reason why this is said in such an indirect/passive way? The
emotional force of the source text is that Adam basically blames his failure on his wife
and that seems to be missing (unless this is the way that he blames her in this language).
See testing question?
\ln 02.11
\co Good question that you have in the anchor line, but it would be better to be in a separate
'co' (comment line) in the BT file, which we'll move here to the ConNotes files.
\ln 02.12
\co the snake *tricked* her, but she doesn't really say that he "ordered" her to do it.
\ln 02.13
\co as you noted in the anchor, this isn't really anchorable and should be left out. See also \cn
\ln 02.14
\ln 02.15
\co I think what you have here is ok.  It's interesting (to me, anyway) that the scripture
passage says, specifically "the *woman*" and "*her* seed" whereas you have just *that
human*. I could find nothing in the exegetical helps which would imply that there's some
special meaning regard the 'woman-ness' of the enemyhood, so I think this is ok. Is there
something in the reference system that forces "that human" to refer specifically to the
woman (as opposed to the man or both indiscrimately).
\ln 02.16
\ln 02.17
\ln 02.18
\co Is there some reason that you have the punishments coming in the order: 1) snake, 2) man,
3) woman when the biblical story has it: snake, woman, and then man? If the crafter just
gave it out of order, then maybe you should revise to be in the same order (esp, if you
have "After that" in one of the punishments). In the "blind man" story, he has the order
as in the scripture, so probably no special reason for the reordering.

whole kingdom: it should be made clear that this was merely something that the king was
thinking about doing, but that it had not actually taken place: compare "it was the king's

\con SH1:  re: "Which one is better..." -- In the text, Jesus says 'which one is easier.'  This is
different than saying 'which one is better.'  Jesus is asking about the difficulty of the
two actions.  See this note from Translator's Notes (TN) that talks about this verse: 
"Which is easier: It is a problem in some languages to translate comparative ideas such
as easier. When you translate this, perhaps you will need to say something like
“Which is easy and which is not easy,” or “Which is easy and which is
difficult.”

\ln 07.13
\con SH1:  re: "Son of Man" -- You will definitely what to test what people understand by this
term.  In other projects, teams have decided to omit 'Son of Man' and just use the
pronoun 'I'.  Here is a note from TN that gives more information about this term:  "When
you translate this name, remember that Jesus was talking about himself, not about
another man. He used this kind of name so people could not say he was speaking too
highly about himself. In your language you may not be able to talk about yourself as if
you were someone else. If so, you will need to try and show in your translation, or in a
note, that Jesus was talking about himself when he used this name."

\co ANCHORS:  You have done a good job in anchoring your stories.  I did want to tell you
that if a story is found in multiple gospels, you do not need to give an anchor from each
gospel.  You can choose one passage as your main source and provide the anchors for
there.  If a different gospel provides some information that is not in your main source
text, then you can add an anchor for that specific information from the other gospel. 
This will save you time as you are anchoring your stories.

\con SH1:  re: "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of God All Powerful
and coming with the clouds of heaven." -- You will definitely want to test this line to find
out what people are understanding.  Do they understand that Jesus is talking about
himself?  One question you could ask is "Why will Jesus be coming with the clouds of
heaven?"

\ln 09.06
\con SH1:  re: "they were so angry" -- A  good testing question to ask here would be "Why
were the religious leaders so angry at Jesus' response?"

\con SH1:  re:  "they were so angry" -- Please add this note to your story file from the
Consultant Notes in TW.  This note is needed to show that the tearing of clothes was a
sign of their anger.   From:  CN:  "Tore his clothes” is an act symbolizing his anger or
chagrin at what he construed as blasphemy," 

\ln 09.07
\con SH1:  re: "He is guilty" -- It would be interesting to ask in testing what people think Jesus
was guilty of.  You could ask questions like "Why did the religious people arrest Jesus? 
Why were they accusing Jesus of doing?"  The answers to these questions will help you
know what additional stories you may need to add to your set.  It is often necessary to
add some stories that mention the growing conflict between Jesus and the religious
leaders.  If their disapproval of him is never mentioned before the crucifixion story, it
can be confusing to people.  They don't understand why anyone would want to kill Jesus.

prisoner each year.   I would recommend either not mentioning Barabbas in the story.  Or
you may need to provide more information about him and this custom of releasing a
prisoner.  You can also test this and see what works best.

\con SH1:  re: "Pilate ordered soldier to nail him to a cross." -- You can remove Mat.27:24
from your anchors because it does not match with this line.

\con SH1:  re: "soldier" -- In Lao, is this word in the plural or singular form?  If it is plural,
can you please adjust the BT using brackets.  For example, "Pilate ordered soldier [MH: 
soldiers]."  If it is in the singular form, then the story will need to be adjusted.

-- Please add Luk.23:34 to your anchors to support this line.

\con SH1:  re: "Jesus prayed to God <<My father, please forgive them because they do not
know what they are doing>>  After Jesus finished praying, he died." -- I feel that the
story does not accurately tell the order of events in this line.  The story gives the
impression that Jesus asked God to forgive them immediately before he died.  However,
there were other things he said before dying.

they were really angels. Also, they suddenly appeared and stood beside the apostles. This
