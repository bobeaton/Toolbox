\bt After David became king and was settled in his palace,
\anc 2Sa.07:01 
\ln 01.02
\bt one day he was with his spiritual advisor, Nathan, and he said to him:  Look!  Here I am living in
this beautiful palace, but the place of worshipping and the holy case for consulting God is out in a
tent. 
\anc 2Sa.07:02 
\ln 01.03
\bt Nathan said to him:  "Well, go ahead and do what you have in mind, because God is with you. 
\anc 2Sa.07:03 
\ln 01.04
\bt But that night Nathan perceived from God that he was guiding him a different way. 
\anc 2Sa.07:04 
\ln 01.05
\bt And he went back to David and said to him:
\anc 2Sa.07:17  
\ln 01.06
\bt <<Here is a message from God for you:  Who are you to build ME a house? 
\anc 2Sa.07:05 (NLT) “Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord says: Are you the one to build me a temple to live
in?
\ln 01.07
\bt I chose you when you were just a shepherd boy taking care of your sheep out in the pasture, and
raised you up to be king of your people, the Israelites. 
\anc 2Sa.07:08 
\bt And I have gotten rid of your enemies. 
\anc 2Sa.07:09 
\ln 01.08
\bt Now  instead of you making ME a house, I am going to make YOU a house, a royal "house" of
David, a dynasty of kings that will go on for all time.   
\anc 2Sa.07:11 (the Lord will build his "house")
\anc 2Sa.07:16 (his dynasty will be permanent)
\ln 01.09
\bt You will have a son, and he will build my house, a temple where people can worship me. And the
line of his descendants will go on being kings forever.>>
\anc 2Sa.07:12 -13
\cn Temple recurs in various stories.
\ln 01.10
\bt When David heard this, he went to the tent of worship, sat down in God's presence, and prayed. 
He said:  "Oh all-powerful God, Who am I that you have brought me this far?  
\anc 2Sa.07:18 
\cn NOTE: re. "went in to the tent" -- HBK says: The fact that he entered into the tent where the ark was housed (see 6.17;
7.2) is implied in the expression "before the Lord"
\ln 01.11
\bt And now you are talking about the kingdom and rule of my descendents going on forever.   
\anc 2Sa.07.19  
\ln 01.12 
\bt So may it happen just like you have promised.  
\anc 2Sa.07.25 
\ln 01.13 
\bt Because when you speak, it is the truth. And this is what you have promised to me, your
SERVANT. 
\anc 2Sa.07.28  
\cn Servant becomes a sub-theme in this panorama, first with David referring to himself as God's servant, then referring to the
Messiah, and then with believers calling themselves servants of God.
