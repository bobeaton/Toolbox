\d God (as in all English translations)
\co "Lord" is not used in this panorama,
as it can have negative
connotations for some modern
secular humanists (e.g. drug lord,
lord of the flies).  Where the biblical
text had "Lord" and is referring to
God it is expressed as "God".

\r Israel 
\d land of Israel
\co Israel in this panorama refers to
the land.  Israelite(s) is used for
the community or people group. In
this panorama Jews are not
distinguished from Israelites.  New
Testament stories refer to Jesus as
Israelites.

\r religious leader
\d Pharisees, Sadducees, High Priests,
leading priests, Scribe, Teacher of
the Law

term for all of theses. Many of the
specific terms like Pharisees,
Sadducees, even High Priest, are
not well known among unchurched
agnostics.

\d prophet
\co Prophet in English has a strong
sense of predicting the future,
whereas the function of prophets in
scripture is to tell messages from
God.  In the Old Testament stories
of this panorama, all of the
"prophets" referred to are spiritual
advisors to kings (Nathan, Isaiah,
Daniel).  Currently, even some
secular government officials get
advice from spiritual advisors.

\r wrong, wrong doing
\d sin
\co done wrong, done great wrong, I
wronged him, etc.  "Sin" is kept
only in the Confession Psalm, due
to the need to have multiple
synonyms for the wrong done, or if
known songs are used for that
part.  Wrong-doing is used in this
panorama for two reasons:  (1)  sin
can be understood to refer only to
very grave wrongs, whereas any
disobedience to God or wrong done
to God or someone else should be
understood to be part of what Jesus
died to forgive.  (2)  sin for a
secular or agnostic audience has a
heavy religious context and
connotation, and may not relate
well to where they come from.
