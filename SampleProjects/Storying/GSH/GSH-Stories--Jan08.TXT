\t DAVID'S ELITE FORCES
\voi July07 CD--transcribed as told by Nathan 
\co Sources:  With numerous translations available in English, this panorama selects from various 
version.  Quite a bit of the panorama follows NLT (New Living Translation), but many key terms and
expressions are made more colloquial than in most translations in order to more appropriate to a
secular audience, and not use church language.
\co Redemptive Theme:   Introduces David as the beginning of the development of a Messiah  (Promised
King / Chosen One) redemptive theme.  The notion of "king" is not an ideal bridge for secular
humanists in the western world who tend to consider royalty as irrelevant or inappropriate to
democracy. But benevolent kings of antiguity is an accepted concept, and for the future fulfillment of
the Messiah concept, an "admired or respected leader" aspect is the one emphasized, and one who will
bring about justice.  In part this theme is used  here by way of example of this particular theme for
training purposes (see comments below on Training Purpose)
\co Redemptive Theme:  This story also introduces a Restored-Relationship theme.  This theme is
considered relevant to a secular humanist worldview in that the modern breakdown of family and 
community, and the uncertainty of the existence of God and purpose in life leaves a void that can be
filled by a good relationship with God, and with godly people. 
\co Worldview Issues:  For a Global Secular / Humanist worldview, largely agnostic and materialist (not
believing in or doubting the existence of the supernatural world), and one in which evolution has had
much influence, this panorama begins with stories that don't immediately confront that worldview.  So
creation in six days, talking snakes in a fall story, a universal flood, and even the  stories of God
speaking directly to Abraham or Moses are avoided as starting points.  Instead, a series of stories that
show a political figure who falls into a sex scandal and cover-up, and then the ramifications of those
are the starting point, as something that is both believable and relevant to the modern agnostic.  A
spiritual relation with God, and God's communication with man is initially presented in the religious
faith and experiences of certain individuals or heroes, rather than starting with statements of outright
assertion about God and his communication with people.
\co Cohesion:  This story first presents David as a man admired by his companions in battle, and one who
has a reverence for God (pouring out the water in offering to God), setting the stage for the sex
scandal and coverup as something out-of-character for him.  
\co Basic Biblical Truth Concepts:  First mention of "God", as one who David has reverence for.
\co Training Notes:  This story in the first part (prior to line 13) is a composite story.  It isn't ideal to start
a panorama with a composite story, particularly in thinking of crafting, but it is useful to have an
example.  It is suggested that for training purposes, in the analytical processing time the training staff
compare the first three stories, perhaps first starting with  story 03 (David & Bathsheba) as an
example of the "best" kind of story that includes practically everything in the  biblical passage; then
story 02 (Promise) which selects parts of a biblical passage that would be too difficult to remember all
of and tell; and then story 01 (David & The Thirty) whose first part is a composite or selection from
various passages.  This sort of composite story is hard to craft, and is not as desireable as a more
normal story like David & Bathsheba, but is sometimes needed, as in this case, to jump into the
middle of things and set appropriate background.
\co Training Notes:  In general the language and key biblical terms and expressions in this panorama are
more colloquial and common than the church language used in most translations.  This is done in large
part to stimulate participants to become aware of the sense of these terms in a  fresh way, much like
mother-tongue speakers might perceive in a receptor language of a storying project which does not yet
have the Bible translated into it.
\cn NOTE: This Global Secular Humanist panorama reflects an ongoing development from various experimental
panoramas used in training in Epic, and later OneStory, from 2004 to the present.  It's ongoing
development was done under the coordination of David & Judy Payne, primarily during the 2004-06 period
that David was serving as training coordinator in OneStory.  Some stories and elements of this panorama
come from a 33-story training set developed by the 2003/04 "Epic Training Development Team" of Jimmy
Douglass, David Greninger, Jon & Sarah Haahr, Curt & Janna Hanover, Nathan Payne, Stephen Stringer.  
Some elements of this panorama were also incorporated from a 40-story Postmodern panorama developed
by Nathan & Katy Payne, Karl & Carrie Fulmer, Brent Lundberg and Clint Cotten & Brandye Hughes.  The
series of David stories was originally developed  by Steve Evans and Grant Lovejoy.  The inclusion of the 
Zacchaeus story is due to Annette Hall.  The current version of the Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53) story is
from Tricia Stringer.  
\ln 01.01
\bt Around three thousand years ago, there was a man named David that lived in Israel. 
He was the youngest of 8 brothers. And his job when he was little was to take care of
his father's sheep. So he was out in the field all the time guarding  the sheep from
wild animals and stuff.
\anc INTRO (3000 year ago)  A Survey of the Old Testament by Andrew E. Hill and John H. Walton page 189
Anointed around 1025 BC. David King's reign 1010-970 BC;  Eerdman's Handbook to the Bible  Page 284
David's reign 1010-970 BC.
\anc 1Sa.17:12, from Bethlehem, eight sons in the family
\anc 1Sa.17:14 youngest (of eight)
\anc 1Sa.17:15 David was going back and forth from Saul in order to care for his father's sheep in
Bethlehem. 
\cn NOTE: Bethlehem is a cohesive element that is revisited below in this same story, and in several
subsequent stories, including the birth of Jesus.
\ln 01.02
\bt When he grew up, he pretty quick became commander of a group of men.  He
was very good at what he did and his men loved him. 
\anc 1Sa.18:05 On every mission on which Saul sent him, David achieved success....
\anc 1Sa.18:13 ...David led the army out to battle and back.
\anc 1Sa.18:30 ...His name was held in high esteem.
\ln 01.03
\bt They'd go out to battle and fight and destroy the enemy.  The enemy would run
away in fear.  He was pretty successful at what he did.
\anc 1Sa.19:08 Now once again there was war. So David went out to fight the Philistines. He defeated them
thoroughly and they ran away from him.  See also NLT <He struck them with such force that they fled
before him.>
\ln 01.04
\bt And I'm going to tell you a little bit about the men that fought for David.  
\anc 2Sa.23.08 These are the names of David's warriors...
\anc 2Sa.23:13 ...three of the thirty leaders went down to David...
\anc 2Sa.23.23 He received honor from the thirty warriors...David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
\cn NOTE: The admiration of his comrades is a cohesive element that makes David's sex scandal and
coverup against two of this group all-the-more egregious.
\ln 01.05
\bt He had three guys who were part of his family. They were his nephews, his
sister's sons.  The oldest one was Joab, and he was David's general. He was in
charge of David's whole army. 
\anc 1Ch.02:13- 16 (Zeruiah was David's sister, her sons were Abshai, Joab & Asahel) 
\anc 2Sa.08:16 Joab son of Zeruiah was general in command of the army...
\anc 2Sa.23:18 Abishai son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, was head of the three. He killed three hundred
men with his spear and gained fame among the three.
\anc 2Sa.23:24 Included with the thirty were the following: Asahel the brother of Joab,
\cn NOTE: The introduction of the two brothers is done for the purpose of giving some character to the
thirty, and for setting up being able to talk about two other related people among the thirty (see Eliam
and Uriah below).
\ln 01.06
\bt Another brother was in charge of David's elite forces. They were thirty or so
guys who were special warriors, excellent warriors. And this guy was in charge
of those guys.   One time in a battle he killed 300 enemies with his spear.
\anc 2Sa 23:18 (see 05)
\ln 01.07
\bt The third brother, they said, was as fast as a gazelle.  Blazing speed--this guy
had.
\anc 2Sa.02:18 The three sons of Zeruiah were there -- Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. (Now Asahel was as
quick on his feet as one of the gazelles in the field.) 
\ln 01.11
\bt There were two other guys that fought for David, who were related to each
other.  There was Eliam and Uriah. Eliam was Uriah's father-in-law. 
\anc 2Sa.23:34 ...Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
\anc 2Sa.23:39 and Uriah the Hittite. Altogether there were thirty-seven.
\cn NOTE: The introduction of these two individuals is for the purpose of having a reference for who
Bathsheba is in the next story, and for making David's betrayal of one of his close comrades
all-the-more egregious.
\ln 01.12
\bt ...
\anc 2Sa.23:24 -39 (list of the thirty)
\ln 01.13
\bt One time, when it was the harvest time of the year, David was outside of
Bethlehem. He was in a cave. And there was an enemy army that had come and
occupied Bethlehem.  Bethlehem was his hometown. That's where he has grown
up and watched his father's sheep. 
\anc 2Sa.23:13 At the time of the harvest three of the thirty leaders went down to David at the cave of
Adullam. A band of Philistines was camped in the valley of Rephaim.
\anc 2Sa.23:14 David was in the stronghold at the time, while a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem.
\anc 1Sa.17:12 Now David was the son of this Ephrathite named Jesse from Bethlehem in Judah.
\cn NOTE: "It was the harvest time of the year" is where the narrative part of this story begins.  This
expression is given in this form to have similarity to the formulaic way that the "David & Bathsheba" 
story begins -- "It was the spring of the year..."
\ln 01.14
\bt And while he was outside of Bethlehem in that cave three of his warriors his elite
forces--three of those guys came to see him.
\anc 2Sa.23:13,14 (see 13)
\ln 01.15
\bt And while they were there, he just kinda said to them, "Man, I wish I had some
of that water from the well in Bethlehem by the gate there." He just kinda said it
in passing. 
\anc 2Sa.23:15 David was thirsty and said, "How I wish someone would give me some water to drink from
the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate!" 
\ln 01.16
\bt Well, the three guys decided that they were going to go get some of that water
for him.  So they broke through the enemy lines, and found the well and got the
water out of it, brought it back, gave it to David for him to drink. 
\anc 2Sa.23:16 So the three elite warriors broke through the Philistine forces and drew some water from
the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate. They carried it back to David, but he refused to drink it. He
poured it out as a drink offering to the Lord
\cn NOTE: re. "even though he really wanted it" -- see Translator's Handbook on 2Sa 23.16 "Although
David wanted very much to drink the water, he offered it to the Lord as a sacrifice."
\cn NOTE: re. "he considered it so valuable" -- see Translator's Notes on 2Sa 23:17b "So, this water
represented their very life-blood. David felt that only the LORD deserved such a sacrifice."
\cn NOTE: We originally worded this line of the story very close to how it is in the NetBible. However, in
several testing groups when they  hearing that wording most of them assumed the 3 man would have
been hurt by David's refusal to drink the water.  So, based on commentary info above, we added the
implied info re. the tremendous value of something that is given to God. 
\ln 01.17
\bt He said, "No, I can't do this. These men could have died getting this water. It's
too much. And so he gave the water to God. He poured it out as an offering to
God.
\anc 2Sa.23:17 and said, "O Lord, I will not do this! It is equivalent to the blood of the men who risked
their lives by going." So he refused to drink it...
\ln 01.18
\bt Now these are just SOME of the things that David and his men were famous for.
They were QUITE an army. 
\anc Summary of story.

\c 02
\t THE PROMISE
\voi July07 CD--transcribed as told by Katy 
\co Redemptive Theme:  This is the initial story to introduce the Messiah theme, as the promise God
made to David of an everlasting kingdom or dynasty.
\co Redemptive Theme:  Restored-Relationship theme.  This story particularly emphasizes the good
relationship between David & God (later broken) 
\co Worldview notes:  For a agnostic / materialist worldview where supernatural is doubted (a
barrier), the introduction of God's influence is seen first in the belief and practice of the
characters rather than stated as outright fact.  This is the case in the previous story and this
story, both for David and Nathan.  Some politicians in todays secular governments occasionally
consult spiritual advisors.  
\co Cohesion:  This story continues to present David as a good man, one who has a reverence for
God, continuing to set the stage for the sex scandal and coverup as something out-of-character
for him.   
\co Basic Biblical Truth Concepts:  Reverence for God.   God makes promises.
\co Training Notes:  This story selects only a few parts of the passage it is taken from.  See notes on
story 01, The Thirty.
\co 02.01
\bt After a while David became king and he settled in his palace in Jerusalem. His
palace was something pretty special and was built of cedar.
\anc 2Sa.05:11  King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and
stonemasons. They built a palace for David.
\anc 2Sa.07:01  The king settled into his palace, for the Lord gave him relief from all his enemies on all
sides.
\ln 02.02
\bt Well, one day he was with his spiritual advisor, Nathan, and told Nathan:  "Look! 
Here I am living in this beautiful palace, but God's Covenant Box is kept out in a
tent." 
\anc 2Sa.07:02 The king said to Nathan the prophet, "Look! I am living in a palace made from cedar, while
the ark of God sits in the middle of a tent."
\ln 02.03
\bt Nathan said to him:  "Well, go ahead and do what you have in mind, because we
know God is with you." 
\anc 2Sa.07:03 Nathan replied to the king, "You should go and do whatever you have in mind, for the Lord
is with you."
\ln 02.04
\bt But that night Nathan felt from God that he was guiding him a different way. 
\anc 2Sa.07:04 That night the Lord told Nathan, ...
\ln 02.05
\bt And he went back to David and said to him:
\anc 2Sa.07:17  Nathan told David all these words that were revealed to him.
\ln 02.06
\bt "Here is a message from God for you:  You will not be the one who will build a
house for me to live in.
\anc 2Sa.07:05 (NLT) “Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord says: Are you the one to build
me a temple to live in?
\cn NOTE: The original wording in our story here was "...message from God for you: Who are YOU to
build a temple for me?"  -- Most of the people tested took it as God bawling David out for daring to
think he could do this for God.  However, from the commentaries, it's clear that the Lord is blessings
David. This line "you are not the one who will build a house for me..."  is followed several verses later
with the opposite, "I am who will build a 'house' for YOU," (referring to the royal "house" of David).
\ln 02.07
\bt I chose you when you were just a shepherd boy taking care of your father's
sheep out in the pasture, and I raised you up to be king of your people, the
Israelites. 
\anc 2Sa.07:08 ...I took you from the pasture and from your work as a shepherd to make you leader of
my people Israel.
\bt And I have gotten rid of your enemies. 
\anc 2Sa.07:09 I was with you wherever you went, and I defeated all your enemies before you....
\ln 02.08
\bt Now  instead of you making ME a house, I am going to make YOU a house, a
royal 'house', a dynasty of kings that will go on for all time.   
\anc 2Sa.07:11 ...The Lord declares to you that he himself will build a dynastic house for you.
\anc 2Sa.07:16 ...Your house and your kingdom will stand before me permanently; your dynasty will be
permanent.'" 
\ln 02.09
\bt You will have a son, and he will build my house, a temple where people can
worship me. And the line of his descendants will go on being kings forever."
\anc 2Sa.07:12 ...I will raise up your descendant, one of your own sons, to succeed you, and I will
establish his kingdom.
\anc 2Sa.07:13 He will build a house for my name, and I will make his dynasty permanent.
\cn NOTE: Temple recurs in various stories.
\ln 02.10
\bt When David heard this, he went to the tent of worship, sat down in God's
presence, and prayed.  He said:  "All-powerful God, Who am I that you have
brought me this far?  
\anc 2Sa.07:18 King David went in, sat before the Lord, and said, "Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my
family, that you should have brought me to this point? 
\cn NOTE: re. "went in to the tent" -- HBK says: The fact that he entered into the tent where the ark was
housed (see 6.17; 7.2) is implied in the expression "before the Lord"
\ln 02.11
\bt And now you are talking about the kingdom and rule of my descendents going on
forever.   
\anc 2Sa.07.19  And you didn't stop there, O Lord God! You have also spoken about the future of your
servant's family. Is this your usual way of dealing with men, O Lord God? 
\ln 02.12 
\bt So may it happen just like you have promised.  
\anc 2Sa.07.25 So now, O Lord God, make this promise you have made about your servant and his family
a permanent reality. Do as you promised,
\ln 02.13 
\bt Because when you speak, it is the truth. And this is what you have promised to
me, your SERVANT." 
\anc 2Sa.07.28  Now, O sovereign Lord, you are the true God! May your words prove to be true! You have
made this good promise to your servant!
\cn NOTE: Servant becomes a sub-theme in this panorama, first with David referring to himself as God's
servant, then referring to the Messiah, and then with believers calling themselves servants of God.

\c 03
\t DAVID & BATHSHEBA 
\voi July07 CD--transcribed as told by Nathan 
\co Redemptive Theme:  Restored-Relationship theme.  This story shows the brokenness of the
relationship between God and man.  
\co Basic Biblical Truth Concepts:  Sin is abhorent to God.
\co Worldview Notes:  Sex scandal by government officials, and coverup, is a compelling issue in todays
secular globalized world.
\co Training Notes:  This story is the first good example of the best model of crafting where the story
includes nearly everything in the bilbical passage.  See notes on story 01, The Thirty.
\ln 03.01
\bt Now, David had been king for some time. And one Spring, he sent his army off to
fight.  Spring was noramlly the time when kings would lead their armies off to go
make war.  And David sent Joab instead to go lead the army. And David stayed back
in Jerusalem. So Joab led the army to fight against this neighboring country. And they
were fighting against this city called Rabbah, trying to take if over. And, like I said,
David stayed back.
\anc 2Sa.11:01  In the spring of the year, at the time when kings normally conduct wars, David sent out Joab
with his officers and the entire Israelite army. They defeated the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But
David stayed behind in Jerusalem.
\cn NOTE: It was the spring....  (see note at 01.13)
\cn NOTE: Rabbah and Jerusalem are referred to in later stories, so are part of the few place names (together
with Bethlehem) that are kept as specific names in this panorama.
\ln 03.02
\bt And one afternoon he had taken a nap and he woke up and he went for a little walk on
the terrace on top of his palace.  And he was looking out over the city and he saw this
woman who was taking a bath.It was a normal thing. She was purifying herself after
her monthly cycle, like they were supposed to do. But David saw her. And he saw that
she was beautiful. She was a "babe".
\anc 2Sa.11:02  One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace. From the
roof he saw a woman bathing. Now this woman was very attractive.
\anc 2Sa.11:04 (B's ritual cleansing from her cycle) ...(Now at that time she was in the process of purifying herself from her menstrual uncleanness.) ...
\cn NOTE: the info about Bathsheba's ritual bathing from her menstrual cycle has been reordered from vs 4 to be more chronological.  Translator's Notes and
Translator's Handbook both back this reordering of information. All of the translations we consulted, except NASB (which is vague) consider this cleansing
to be because of her menstrual cycle, rather than a cleansing after having had intercourse.
\ln 03.03
\bt And so he sent someone to go find out who she was. And the guy came back , and
said, "She is Bathsheba, Uriah's wife Eliam's daughter." 
\anc 2Sa.11:03  So David sent someone to inquire about the woman. The messenger said, "Isn't this Bathsheba,
the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
\cn NOTE: With the names of Eliam and Uriah the Hittite having been introduced in the story of The Thirty,
thisshould take on special significant to have them named here.
\ln 03.04
\bt Well...David called her into his palace, slept with her and then sent her back home. 
\anc 2Sa.11:04  David sent some messengers to get her. She came to him and he had sexual relations with
her.(Now at that time she was in the process of purifying herself from her menstrual uncleanness.) Then she
returned to her home.
\ln 03.05
\bt Well, pretty soon, he got word back from her that she was pregnant.
\anc 2Sa.11:05 The woman conceived and then sent word to David saying, "I'm pregnant."
\ln 03.06
\bt So what did David do? He called Uriah back from the battle.   
\anc 2Sa.11:06  So David sent a message to Joab that said, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent
Uriah to David.
\ln 03.07
\bt He had him report on how things were going--how the battle was going, and stuff.
\anc 2Sa.11:07  When Uriah came to him, David asked about how Joab and the army were doing and how the
campaign was going.
\ln 03.08
\bt And then said, "Well, ok, Uriah, you go on back to you house and relax." So Uriah left.
\anc 2Sa.11:08  Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your home and relax." When Uriah left the palace, the
king sent a gift to him.
\ln 03.09
\bt But instead of going home, he spent the night at the entrance to the palace entrance
David's other servants slept.
\anc 2Sa.11:09  But Uriah stayed at the door of the palace with all the servants of his lord. He did not go down to
his house. 
\ln 03.10
\bt Well, in the morning when David found out that Uriah had not gone home, he called
him in and he said, "Man, what's wrong with you? I told you you could go home. How
come you didn't go?" 
\anc 2Sa.11:10  So they informed David, "Uriah has not gone down to his house." So David said to Uriah,
"Haven't you just arrived from a journey? Why haven't you gone down to your house?" 
\ln 03.11
\bt Uriah said, "King, the army and God's Covenant are out in the fields.  They're sleeping
in TENTS, fighting the war.  I can't go home and eat a meal with my wife and sleep
with her. It's just not right." 
\anc 2Sa.11:11  Uriah replied to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah reside in temporary shelters, and my lord
Joab and my lord's soldiers are camping in the open field. Should I go to my house to eat and drink and
have marital relations with my wife? As surely as you are alive, I will not do this thing!" 
\ln 03.12
\bt So David said, "Well ok, spend another night here, and tomorrow I'll send  you back."
\anc 2Sa.11:12  So David said to Uriah, "Stay here another day. Tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah
stayed in Jerusalem both that day and the following one.
\ln 03.13
\bt So the next day, David called him in to have a meal with him. And he got got him
DRUNK, thinking that THEN he'd go home for sure. But he still didn't. The guy did the
same thing. He slept at the entrance to the palace. 
\anc 2Sa.11:13  Then David summoned him. He ate and drank with him, and got him drunk. But in the
evening he went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his lord; he did not go down to his own
house.
\ln 03.14
\bt Well, when David found out, this time, he wrote a letter--a letter to Joab that said, 
\anc 2Sa.11:14  In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
\ln 03.15
\bt "Put Uriah at the front lines of the battle where the fighting is real fierce, so that he'll
die." And after he'd written the letter he gave it to Uriah to take to Joab.   Uriah,
himself, was the one that took the letter. 
\anc 2Sa.11:15  In the letter he wrote: "Station Uriah in the thick of the battle and then withdraw from him so he
will be cut down and killed."
\anc 2Sa.11:14 ...sent it with Uriah
\ln 03.16
\bt And when Joab saw the letter he did what David said. And he put Uriah at the front,  
\anc 2Sa.11:16  So as Joab kept watch on the city, he stationed Uriah at the place where he knew the best
enemy soldiers were. 
\ln 03.17
\bt and sure enough when the enemy came out to fight, Uriah got killed. 
\anc 2Sa.11:17  When the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, some of David's soldiers fell in
battle. Uriah the Hittite also died.
\ln 03.18
\bt So Joab called a messenger to send back to David.  
\anc 2Sa.11:18  Then Joab sent a full battle report to David.
\ln 03.19
\bt He said, "Go and tell David what happened. Tell him that we were fighting in Rabbah
and going up close to the walls of the city and that the archers came out  and shot
down on us. And several men were killed.
\anc 2Sa.11:19  He instructed the messenger as follows: "When you finish giving the battle report to the
king,
\ln 03.20
\bt He he might start to get mad, and say 'Why were you so close to the city walls?' and
stuff like that.  
\anc 2Sa.11:20  if the king becomes angry and asks you, ‘Why did you go so close to the city to fight? Didn't you
realize they would shoot from the wall? 
\ln 03.21
\bt So tell him,  'Well Uriah was killed.' "
\anc 2Sa.11:21  ...just say to him, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'"
\ln 03.22
\bt So the messenger went and he told David everything that Joab told him to say.
\anc 2Sa.11:22  So the messenger departed. When he arrived, he informed David of all the news that Joab had
sent with him. 
\ln 03.23
\bt ...
\anc 2Sa.11:23  The messenger said to David, "The men overpowered us and attacked us in the field. But we
forced them to retreat all the way to the door of the city gate. 
\ln 03.24
\bt ...
\anc 2Sa.11:24  Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall and some of the king's soldiers died. Your
servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead." 
\ln 03.25

\t THE LAMB STORY
\voi July07 CD--transcribed as told by Judy 
\co Basic Biblical Truth Concepts:  God is almighty (caused David to become king); forgiveness from
God
\co Training Notes:  This is a story within a story, and a great example of the power of a story. 
Nathan didn't immediately confront the king, but let him come to terms with his guilt through
the story.  Stories aren't just for kids -- they are for kings.
\ln 04.01
\bt Well, God was SO displeased with what David had done
\anc 2Sa.11:27  ...But what David had done upset the Lord.
\ln 04.02
\bt So he sent Nathan, to tell David this story:
\anc 2Sa.12:01  So the Lord sent Nathan to David. When he came to David, Nathan said, "There were two
men in a certain city, ...
\ln 04.03
\bt "In a certain town there were two men. One was really rich, and one was poor.
\anc 2Sa.12:01  ..."There were two men in a certain city, one rich and the other poor.
\ln 04.04
\bt The rich man owned lots of sheep and cattle. 
\anc 2Sa.12:02  The rich man had a great many flocks and herds.
\ln 04.05
\bt But the poor man owned nothing except one little lamb. And he had worked hard
to buy that lamb. He raised it along with his children. It ate from the man's own
plate and drank from his cup. He carried it around in his arms like a baby
daughter.
\anc 2Sa.12:03  But the poor man had nothing except for a little lamb he had acquired. He raised it, and it
grew up alongside him and his children. It used to eat his food, drink from his cup, and sleep in his
arms. It was just like a daughter to him.
\ln 04.06
\bt One day a guest came to the home of the rich man. And he wanted to feed him a
meal. But instead of taking a lamb from his own flocks for food, he took the poor
man's lamb and killed it and served it to his guest."
\anc 2Sa.12:04  "When a traveler arrived at the rich man's home, he did not want to use one of his own
sheep or cattle to feed the traveler who had come to visit him. Instead, he took the poor man's lamb
and cooked it for the man who had come to visit him."
\ln 04.07
\bt When David heard the story he was furious. He said "That guy showed
absolutely NO pity at all, he needs to give the poor man four lambs to replace
the one he took!
\anc 2Sa.12:05  Then David became very angry at this man. ...
\anc 2Sa.12:06  Because he committed this cold-hearted crime, he must pay for the lamb four times over!"
\ln 04.08
\bt In fact, any man who would do something like that deserves to die!
\anc 2Sa.12:05  ...He said to Nathan, "As surely as the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die!
\cn We reordered David's two statements giving the important one 2nd position--to make it more
memorable (English storying technique).  It then ties more naturally with what Nathan says
below--that David doesn't have to die (for what he did). 
\ln 04.09
\bt Then Nathan said to David, "You are that man! Here is what God says, 'I made
you king of Israel.
\anc 2Sa.12:07  Nathan said to David, "You are that man! This is what the Lord God of Israel says: ‘I chose
you to be king over Israel and I rescued you from the hand of Saul.
\ln 04.10
\bt I gave you the palace and wives and the kingdom of the former king. And if that
had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more.
\anc 2Sa.12:08  I gave you your master's house, and put your master's wives into your arms. I also gave
you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all that somehow seems insignificant, I would have given
you so much more as well!
\ln 04.11
\bt Why, then, have you disobeyed me and done this horrible thing? For you have
MURDERED Uriah and have STOLEN his wife.
\anc 2Sa.12:09  Why have you shown contempt for the word of the Lord by doing evil in my sight? You
have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and you have taken his wife as your own! ...
\ln 04.12
\bt You have despised me by doing this, and so, from this time on, your family will
be plagued by violence.
\anc 2Sa.12:10  So now the sword will never depart from your house. For you have despised me by taking
the wife of Uriah the Hittite as your own!' 
\ln 04.14
\bt Then David confessed to Nathan, "Oh! I have done a terrible thing against God."
\anc 2Sa.12:13  Then David exclaimed to Nathan, "I have sinned against the Lord!" ...
\ln 04.15
\bt Nathan answered, "Yes, but He has forgiven you, and YOU won't die for what
you did.
\anc 2Sa.12:13  Nathan replied to David, "Yes, and the Lord has forgiven your sin. You are not going to
die. 
\ln 04.16
\bt But you have given God's enemies SUCH an opportunity to despise and ridicule
him.  And because of that, your baby will die."
\anc 2Sa.12:14  Nonetheless, because you have treated the Lord with such contempt in this matter, the
son who has been born to you will certainly die." 
\ln 04.17
\bt And Nathan returned to his home.
\anc 2Sa.12:15  Then Nathan went to his home. ...

lying on the ground. 
\ln 05.06
\bt David's advisors became very worried about him and they said, "Come, David,
eat with us!"  And David refused. 
\anc 2Sa.12:17  The elders of his house stood over him and tried to lift him from the ground, but he was
unwilling, and refused to eat food with them.
\ln 05.07
\bt And seven days later, his child did die. And his advisors didn't know exactly how
to tell him that his child had died. They said to themselves, "Well, if he was this
broken up He was so broken up about his child just being ILL, what's he going to
do to himself when he finds out the child is dead?"
\anc 2Sa.12:18  On the seventh day the child died. But the servants of David were afraid to inform him
that the child had died, for they said, "While the child was still alive he would not listen to us when we
spoke to him. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He will do himself harm!" 
\ln 05.08
\bt But when David saw them whispering, he said, "Is the child dead?" And they
said, "Yes, he is."
\anc 2Sa.12:19  When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he realized that the
child was dead. So David asked his servants, "Is the child dead?" They replied, "Yes, he's dead." 
\ln 05.09
\bt And so David got up, and he went and he bathed and he, put on lotions, and
changed his clothes. Then he went to the tent of worship and he worshiped God
there. After that, he returned to the palace and ate.
\anc 2Sa.12:20  So David got up from the ground, bathed, put on oil, and changed his clothes. He went to
the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then, when he entered his palace, he requested that food be
brought to him, and he ate.
\ln 05.10
\bt His advisors were amazed. They said, "David, we don't understand you. While
the baby was ill you were fasting and weeping, but now that he's dead you've
stopped your mouring and you're eating again.
\anc 2Sa.12:21  His servants said to him, "What is this that you have done? While the child was still alive,
you fasted and wept. Once the child was dead you got up and ate food!" 
\ln 05.11
\bt And David answered, "While my child was still alive, I thought that perhaps God
would be kind to me and spare the child's life.
\anc 2Sa.12:22  He replied, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept because I thought, ‘Perhaps
the Lord will show pity and the child will live.

he cannot return to me!'"

\bt Then David went to his wife Bathsheba and he comforted her.  And they slept
together and she conceived. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and
they named him Solomon.

\ln 07.02
\bt And so Joab sent messengers to tell David, "I have fought against Rabbah and

pounds, and held a precious stone -- and it was placed on David's head. He also took from the city a
great deal of plunder.
\cn NOTE: We originally included the info that the crown weighed about 75 pounds, the testing groups
consistently laughed at this.  The thought of putting something which weighed 75lbs on your head was
absurd to them, and they missed the fact that the weight implied the value of it. TN says: "However,
another possibility is that it is not the weight of the crown which is being spoken of, but its value. That
is, the gold crown with its jewels “were equal in value to a talent of gold” (Clarke, page 340)."
\ln 07.06
\bt He made the people  slaves and put them all to work, and then David returned to
Jerusalem, victorious.
\anc 2Sa.12:31  He removed the people who were in it and made them do hard labor with saws, iron picks,
and iron axes, putting them to work at the brick kiln. This was his policy with all the Ammonite cities.
Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.

\co Basic Biblical Truth Concepts:  Forgiveness of sins
\co Cohesion:  Several aspects of this are referred to in the trial and death story:  silent, no fair trail,
innocent, criminals killed with him, placed in a rich man's tomb.
\co Training notes: The Suffering Servant story continues the narrowing of the Gods Servant /
Messiah theme and promise referenced in the previous story, with the Promised King cohesion at
the beginning and end of this new passage (52:13 and 53:12). For the new element of suffering
sandwiched between those, if the story crafter plans to do this in a narrative and meaning-based
format, it will enhance learnability / reproducibility of the story if only certain highly visual
metaphors are retained, e.g.   1. tender shoot growing up out of parched ground (53:2),   2.
sheep going astray (53:6),  3. silent sheep let to the slaughter (53:7).  Alternatively or in

and everyone had to go to their own home town to be registered. So Joseph took
Mary and they went to the town of Bethlehem, where King David, their ancestor,
had been from.

manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

after the birth, they took Jesus up to Jerusalem to the temple.

Lord's Christ. 
\ln 11.13
\bt That day he felt compelled to go to the the Temple. So when Mary and Joseph
came to present the their baby before God,

brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary according to the law,

\bt About 30 years later, there was a man named John, who lived in the wilderness
outside of Jerusalem. 
\anc Luk.03:02 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son
of Zechariah in the wilderness.
\anc Luk.03.23 ... Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years old.
\ln 12.02
\bt And he would go up and down on both sides of the Jordan River, teaching that
people should receive the ceremonial washing to show that they had turned
away from their wrong doing and turned to God for forgiveness. 
\anc Luk.03:03  He went into all the region around the Jordan River, preaching a baptism of repentance for
the forgiveness of sins.
\ln 12.03
\bt People from all over -- Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley would come to hear him.

were going out to him, 
\ln 12.04
\bt And when they confessed their wrong doing, John would them this ceremonial
washing there in the River. 
\anc Mat.03:06 and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.
\ln 12.05
\bt One day a bunch of religious leaders came, and when John saw them coming, he
yelled at them.  “He said, "You brook of vipers! Who told you to come?
\anc Mat.03:07 But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them,
"You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
\ln 12.06
\bt Show by the way you are living that you have turned from your wrong doing, and
turned to God." 
\anc Luk.03:08  Therefore produce fruit that proves your repentance...
\ln 12.07
\bt Now some crooked tax collectors also came out there for the ceremonial
washing and said, "Teacher, what should WE do?" 
\anc Luk.03:12  Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what should we
do?"
\cn NOTE: "Corrupt" is a contextual gap supplied here because most unchurched hearers are unable to
comprehend why tax collectors are always considered to be sinners in the Gospels.
\ln 12.08
\bt And John answered, "Show that you're honest. Don't  Make collect any more
(taxes) than the Roman government requires." 
\anc Luk.03:13  He told them, "Collect no more than you are required to." 
\ln 12.10
\bt Now, everyone was expecting the Promised King to come soon, and they were
all wondering if perhaps John was the one. 
\anc Luk.03:15 While the people were filled with anticipation and they all wondered whether perhaps John
could be the Christ, 
\ln 12.11
\bt Well, John answered what they were all thinking, he said, "I use water for this
ceremonial washing; but one is coming after me who is far greater than I am. 
He will fill you with the Holy Spirit. He will fill you so full you'll be drenching."
\cn NOTE she omitted "So much greater that I am not even worthy to be his slave.  (may want to add this

\anc Luk.03:16  John answered them all, "I baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I am is
coming -- I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and

\voi July07 CD--transcribed as told by Phil 
\co Redemptive Theme: Messiah, people started believing that he was the Promised King.
\co Basic Biblical Truth Concepts:  Jesus as God's Son
\co Cohesion:  Begins to set up the conflict of Jesus with the religious leaders in a way that has their

\co Cohesion:  Jesus says "destroy this temple and I'll build it up in three days",  which is later
referred to in his trial (see Trial story)
\ln 13.01
\bt At one of the annual celebrations, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
\anc Jhn.02:13  Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\ln 13.02
\bt And when he arrived in the Temple area he saw people who were selling cattle,
sheep, and doves. And there were people who would come and buy these
aniamls and give them as offering in the Temple. And there were men who were
money changers at tables. People would exchang their money into the currency
for the Temple. 
\anc Jhn.02:14  He found in the temple courts those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the
money changers sitting at tables.
\cn NOTE: "...for the offerings to God" and "...people who had come from other countries and who had to
pay in the local temple currency."  These are contextual gaps which most unchurched hearers do not
understand and are confused by as to why there are animals and moneychangers in the Temple
area.  TH (Translator's Handbook) says:  "The animals and birds were there to be sold to persons who
came to offer sacrifices, while the moneychangers were there to change Roman coins into Jewish
coins, since no coins bearing imperial or Roman portraits were permitted to be used to pay the temple
tax." 
\ln 13.03
\bt Jesus was disturbed by this. He made a whip out of rope. And he drove out the
cattle and the sheep. And he chased away the marketers (merchants). And he
went over to the tables and he threw away all the coins and he overturned the
tables.  
\anc Jhn.02:15  So he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, with the sheep
and the oxen. He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 
\ln 13.04
\bt Then, he went to where they were selling the doves, and he said, "Get these out
of here. Don't turn my Father's house into a marketplace!" 
\anc Jhn.02:16  To those who sold the doves he said, "Take these things away from here! Do not make my
Father's house a marketplace!"
\ln 13.05
\bt When the religious rulers, seeing this, went to Jesus and said: "What are you
doing? By who's authority are you doing this? If your authority is from God, show
us a sign, show us a MIRACULOUS sign." 
\anc Jhn.02:18  So then the Jewish leaders responded, "What sign can you show us, since you are doing
these things?" 
\ln 13.06
\bt And Jesus said, "All right, if you'll destroy this temple,  in three days I'll raise it
up." 
\anc Jhn.02:19  Jesus replied, "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up again."
\ln 13.07
\bt And the religious rulers said, "How can this be?  It took YEARS to build this
Temple, how is it possible that you could raise this up in three days?" 
\anc Jhn.02:20  Then the Jewish leaders said to him, "This temple has been under construction for forty-six
years, and are you going to raise it up in three days?" 
\ln 13.09
\bt The festival continued.  And during the festival, Jesus did several miracles, and 
many people came to be convinced that Jesus  was the Promised King. 
\anc Jhn.02:23  Now while Jesus was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, many people believed in
his name because they saw the miraculous signs he was doing.

\t PARALYTIC
\voi July07 CD--transcribed as told by Chet 
\co Redemptive Theme: Son of Man. Response to the redemptive themes of Restored Relationship
and Son of Man find expression in Luk 5:20,24 (their faith/trust, sins are forgiven, Son of Man
has authority to forgive)
\co Basic Biblical Truth Concepts:  Forgiveness of sins
\co Cohesion:  Continues to set up the conflict of Jesus with the religious leaders in a way that has
their wanting to execute him seem realistic.  But people in general are amazed at Jesus' power.
\ln 14.01
\bt Well, one day while Jesus was teaching in a house, and there were spiritual
(religious) leaders there were who always seemed to be there when Jesus was
teaching.
\anc Luk.05:17  Now on one of those days, while he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of
the law sitting nearby (who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem),
and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.
\ln 14.02
\bt And along came some men came carrying a paralytic man on a sleeping mat.
And they tried to get into the house 
\anc Luk.05:18  Just then some men showed up, carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They were
trying to bring him in and place him before Jesus.
\ln 14.03
\bt but there were just too many people blocking the way. So they went up on the
terrace (on top of the house), moved aside some tiles, and lowered the man on
his sleeping mat, down in front of Jesus. 
\anc Luk.05:19  But since they found no way to carry him in because of the crowd, they went up on the
roof and let him down on the stretcher through the roof tiles right in front of Jesus.
\cn NOTE: "...terrace on top of the house" is used for "roof", and fills a contextual gap, because many
hearers are unfamiliar with flat roofed houses with terraces, and are confused and distracted as to
how the men could get onto the roof with a stretcher.  TN (Translator's Notes in Translator's
Workplace) says "the tops of the houses were flat so people could walk on them. Many houses had
outside steps that led up to the roof. People would often sit and talk on the roof in the cool of the
evening." 
\ln 14.04
\bt Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man, "Friend, your wrong doings are
forgiven." 
\anc Luk.05:20  When Jesus saw their faith he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven." 
\ln 14.05
\bt Oh! The spiritual leaders were thinking to themselves, "This is an offense against
God! Who does this man think he is? Only GOD can forgive someone of their
wrongdoing!" 
\anc Luk.05:21  Then the experts in the law and the Pharisees began to think to themselves, "Who is this
man who is uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 
\ln 14.06
\bt Jesus, knowing what they were thinking, he asked the religious leaders, "Why do
you say this is an offense against God? 
\anc Luk.05:22  When Jesus perceived their hostile thoughts, he said to them, "Why are you raising
objections within yourselves? 
\ln 14.07
\omit OMITTED: Is it easier to say, 'Your wrong doing is forgiven' or 'Get up and walk'? 
\anc Luk.05:23  Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, ‘Stand up and walk'?
\ln 14.08
\bt Ok, to prove to you that the Son of Man has the power on earth to forgive wrong
doing, I will prove this to you." And so Jesus said to the (paralyzed) man, "Stand
up, take your mat, and go home!" 
\anc Luk.05:24  But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" -- he
said to the paralyzed man -- "I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher and go home." 
\ln 14.09
\bt And immediately, the man jumped to his feet, picked up his mat, and went home
praising God. 
\anc Luk.05:25  Immediately he stood up before them, picked up the stretcher he had been lying on, and
went home, glorifying God. 
\ln 14.10
\bt Everyone was astonished! And they praised God, saying over and over again,
"Truly we have seen a wonderful thing!"
\anc Luk.05:26  Then astonishment seized them all, and they glorified God. They were filled with awe,
saying, "We have seen incredible things today."

\co Redemptive Theme: Restored Relationship:  This parable is the essence of the Restored
Relationship theme. Response to the redemptive theme of Restored Relationship finds expression
in Luke 15:21-22,24,31-32 (I’ve sinned against God and you, I’m not worthy to be your son,
dead/alive, lost/found, you are always with me, everything I have is yours.)
\co Cohesion:  Even with this theme, the characterization of the religious leaders as like the older
son continues to set up the conflict that results in Jesus' execution.
\ln 15.01
\bt Corrupt tax collectors and other outcasts who were considered the scum of
society often came to listen to Jesus teach. 
\anc Luk.15:01  
\cn NOTE: "Corrupt" is a contextual gap supplied here because most unchurched hearers are unable to
comprehend why tax collectors are always considered to be sinners in the Gospels.
\ln 15.02
\bt Well the religious leaders really didn't like that Jesus would associate with such
despicable people.  They would say to themselves, "Why would a religious
teacher, like Jesus, eat with these sort of people?" 
\anc Luk.15:02  
\ln 15.03
\bt So Jesus, to answer their questions, told them gave them some stories -- One of
them was about a father and two sons.  
\anc Luk.15:03  So Jesus told them this parable:
\cn NOTE: actually it was several stories, but we're only using the last one.
\anc Luk.15:11  Then Jesus said, "A man had two sons.
\ln 15.04
\bt One day the younger son came to his father and said:  "Father, I would like my
share of your estate now, before you die."  So his father agreed to divide his
wealth between his sons. 
\anc Luk.15:12   The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that will
belong to me.' So he divided his assets between them.
\ln 15.05
\bt A few days later this younger son packed up all his belongings and took a trip to
a distant country, where he wasted all his money on wild living. 
\anc Luk.15:13   After a few days, the younger son gathered together all he had and left on a journey to a
distant country, and there he squandered his wealth with a wild lifestyle.
\ln 15.06
\bt About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he
began to starve. 
\anc Luk.15:14  Then after he had spent everything, a severe famine took place in that country, and he
began to be in need.
\ln 15.07
\bt He persuaded a local farmer to hire him to feed his pigs. 
\anc Luk.15:15  So he went and worked for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to
feed pigs.
\ln 15.08
\bt Well, the poor boy was so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs
looked good to him. But no one gave him anything to eat. 
\anc Luk.15:16  He was longing to eat the carob pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.
\ln 15.09
\bt When he finally came to his senses, he thought to himself, "Y'know, back home
even the hired men have food enough to spare, and here I am, starving to
death! 
\anc Luk.15:17  But when he came to his senses he said, ‘How many of my father's hired workers have
food enough to spare, but here I am dying from hunger!
\ln 15.10
\bt So here's what I'll do. I will go back home and tell my father, 'I have done wrong
against God and against you, 
\anc Luk.15:18  I will get up and go to my father and say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven
and against you.
\ln 15.11
\bt and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as your
hired man.' " 
\anc Luk.15:19  I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired workers."'
\ln 15.12
\bt So the younger son went home. And while he was still a long ways off, his father
saw him coming in the distance, and he ran out to meet him. And he threw his
arms around him and gave him a big hug!
\anc Luk.15:20  So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way from home his father
saw him, and his heart went out to him; he ran and hugged his son and kissed him.
\cn NOTE: left out the kiss, since it isn't culturally done between men.
\ln 15.13
\bt The younger son said to his father, "I have done wrong against God and against
you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son." 
\anc Luk.15:21  Then his son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I am no
longer worthy to be called your son.' 
\ln 15.14
\bt But his father turned to his servants and said, "Quick! Go get the finest robe in
the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger, and sandals for his feet. 
\anc Luk.15:22  But the father said to his slaves, ‘Hurry! Bring the best robe, and put it on him! Put a ring
on his finger and sandals on his feet!

\bt for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now

began to celebrate.

\t TRIAL
\voi July07 CD--transcribed as told by Nathan 
\co Redemptive Theme: Messiah (Are you the promised King), Son of Man
\co Basic Biblical Truth Concepts:  (Suffered) under Pontius Pilate
\co Cohesion:  Needed background for the death of Jesus (next story); cohesion with Temple story (I
will rebuild the temple in three days); Suffering Servant story mentions being silent, unfair trial
\ln 18.01
\bt Not long after that, Jesus went to Jerusalem. And every day he would go to the
Temple and teach the people.  And the people just loved his teaching. They hung
on every word he said. And the religious and political leaders there, as you
know, hated Jesus and were looking for a way to get rid of him--to kill him. 
\anc Luk.19:47,48  Jesus was teaching daily in the temple courts. The chief priests and the experts in the
law and the prominent leaders among the people were seeking to assassinate him, but they could not
find a way to do it, for all the people hung on his words.
\ln 18.02
\bt But the people just loved him so much that they weren't quite sure how they
could do that--so they were thinking how they might do that.  
\anc Luk.19.47,48  
\ln 18.03
\bt And one day, after Jesus had been in Jerusalem for about a week, he went up
with his followers to an olive grove called Gethsemane, and he was praying
there,
\anc Mat.26.36  Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, "Sit
here while I go over there and pray." 
\ln 18.04
\bt And so up comes this mob, 
\anc Mat.26.47  While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd
armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
\ln 18.05
\bt and they arrested Jesus and took him to the high priest's house, where this 
ruling council of religious leaders was all convened to decide what they were
going to do with Jesus. 
\anc Mat.26.57  Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house
the experts in the law and the elders had gathered.
\ln 18.06
\bt And so, they were looking for witnesses, people that would say stuff about Jesus
so that they could execute him.
\anc Mat.26.59  The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus
so that they could put him to death. 
\ln 18.07
\bt But they couldn't even find two people who would give the same lie so they
could do it to Jesus. Until finally they found two
\anc Mat.26.60  But they did not find anything, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two
came forward 
\ln 18.08
\bt that said, "This man said that he was able to destroy the temple and rebuild it in
three days." 
\anc Mat.26.61  and declared, "This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in
three days.'"
\ln 18.09
\bt So the high priest turned to Jesus and he said, "So, do you have anything to
say? All these accusations against you. Are you going to say anything? You
going to answer?"
\anc Mat.26.62  So the high priest stood up and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is this that they
are testifying against you?"
\ln 18.10
\bt But Jesus didn't say anything. So the high priest says, "I demand in the name of
the living God that you tell us whether or not you are the Promised King!" 
\anc Mat.26.63  But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living
God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
\ln 18.11
\bt And Jesus said, "Yes, it is as you say. And you will see the Son of Man seated at
the right hand of God in the seat of power. And you'll see him coming in the
clouds of heaven." 
\anc Mat.26.64  Jesus said to him, "You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see the
Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."
\ln 18.12
\bt Well, when the high priest heard that, he tore his clothing in dusgust, and he
shouted, "What more do we need to hear! We don't need any more witnesses.
This man has incriminated himself! 
\anc Mat.26.65  Then the high priest tore his clothes and declared, "He has blasphemed! Why do we still
need witnesses? Now you have heard the blasphemy!
\ln 18.13
\bt What do you say we should do with him?" Asking the other people there. And
they said, "Kill him! He needs to die! Execute him!"
\anc Mat.26.66  What is your verdict?" They answered, "He is guilty and deserves death." 
\ln 18.14
\bt So that all happened that night. And they held on to Jesus, and in the morning,
they reconvened to decide how they were going to go about it. And they decided
to try to get the Romans, you know, who were occupying the land at that time,
to execute him.
\anc Mat.27:01  When it was early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted
against Jesus to execute him. 
\ln 18.15
\bt So they took  they him to Pilate. Pilate was the Roman governor in charge of that
area.
\anc Mat.27:02  They tied him up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
\ln 18.16 
\bt And they brought all these accusations against him. And so Pilate asked him:
"So, are you these people's King?"  And Jesus answered, "Yes." 
\anc Mat.27:11  Then Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of
the Jews?" Jesus said, "You say so."
\ln 18.17
\bt So, all that time, the religious leaders were accusing Jesus of all these things,
and you know, he didn't answer, didn't say anything. And Pilate was just
surprised that he sat there (error) STOOD there in silence.
\anc Mat.27:12  But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond.
\anc Mat.27:14  But he did not answer even one accusation, so that the governor was quite amazed.
\ln 18.18
\bt And Pilate didn't think Jesus was guilty of anything, definitely not guilty
(enough) to receive the death penalty.  
\anc Mat.27:13  Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how many charges they are bringing against
you?" 
\anc Mat 27:24
\ln 18.19
\omit OMITTED: But Jesus said nothing, much to the governor's great surprise. 
\anc Mat.27:14  But he did not answer even one accusation, so that the governor was quite amazed.
\ln 18.20
\bt And he had a custom, that every year at the time when there was this festival,
he would always release one prisoner to the people.  And he knew that the
religious leaders had brought Jesus because they were jealous of his popularity,
so he figured that the people would like Jesus if he offered to release Jesus to
them.
\anc Mat.27:15  During the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd,
whomever they wanted. 
\cn NOTE: NOTE: "at that time" refers to the Passover celebration, but since we haven't introduced the
Passover in this set, we leave it vague.
\cn Morris' Commentary on Matthew says <<Matthew adds that Pilate was not taken in by what the Jewish
leaders were saying. He knew that it was not consideration for the security of Roman rule that had
motivated them, but envy. Their envy at the success of Jesus in Jerusalem during the past few days
would have reinforced their long-standing hatred of him. It may well be that Pilate knew of this and
reasoned that since the leaders were jealous of Jesusâ€™ popularity with the crowd, he must have
sufficient support among the people for them to ask for his release. Ordinary people would surely side
with Jesus rather than with a criminal like Barabbas. So he put the choice before them, thinking that in
this way he would be able to release Jesus. If the leaders were jealous of Jesusâ€™ popularity with the
crowd, then the â€œMessiahâ€ must have sufficient support in the crowd for them to ask for him to be set
free.>>
\ln 18.21
\omit MOVED: This year there was a notorious criminal in prison, a man named Barabbas. 
\anc Mat.27:16  At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
\ln 18.22
\bt And so he looks at the people and says, "Which one do you want? Jesus the
King? or Barrabas?" ...who was a criminal, a lowdown guy who had done all sorts
of stuff
\anc Mat.27:17  So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for
you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?" 
\anc Mat.27:16  At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
\ln 18.23
\bt Now, the religious leaders had stirred up and incited the crowd that they started
yelling 
\anc Mat.27:20  But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have
Jesus killed. 
\ln 18.24
\bt "Barabbas! Give us Barrabas! Barrabas!" 
\anc Mat.27:21  ...And they said, "Barabbas!" 
\ln 18.26
\bt And so Pilate said: "Well, ok, what do you want me to do with Jesus?" And they
all shouted, "Kill him! Execute him! Kill him!" 
\anc Mat.27:22
\ln 18.27
\bt “So ”Pilate says. "Well, what crime has he committed? He hasn't done anything."
But the crowd just kept more and more, "Execute him! Kill him!" Just getting so
riled up about it.
\anc Mat.27:23  Pilate said to them, "Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all
said, "Crucify him!" 
\anc Mat.27:
\ln 18.28
\bt So finally Pilate gave in to them and he released Barabbas. He ordered Jesus to
be whipped, then turned him over to the  soldiers to be executed.
\anc Mat.27:26  Then he released Barabbas for them. But after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over
to be crucified.

\ln 22.01
\bt Some time later, after Jesus had gone up to heaven, his followers did begin go
out to the other nations tell people the good news about Jesus. 
\anc Act.13:03, 04
\ln 22.02
\bt And many believed and they were filled with the Holy Spirit, just like Jesus had
said.
\anc Act.04.31  When they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken, and
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God courageously.
\ln 22.03
\bt One of the believers was a man named Paul, began to take long trips to different
countries telling about Jesus. 
\anc Act.13:13, Act.14:09, Act.16.01
\ln 22.02
\bt Paul, along with his co-workers Silas and Timothy were traveling through what
today we call Turkey. They would have preached about Jesus there, but for some
reason God's Spirit prevented them from doing it.
\anc act.16:06 They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been prevented by the Holy
Spirit from speaking the message in the province of Asia.
\ln 22.03
\bt So they continued on, and headed in a different direction, but the Spirit of Jesus
didn't allow them to do that either,
\anc act.16:07 When they came to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not
allow them to do this, 
\ln 22.04
\bt So they continued on to another town, and then another.
\anc act.16:08 so they passed through Mysia and went down to Troas. 
\ln 22.05
\bt Then one night Paul had a vision.  In that vision he saw a man from across the
water in Macedonia standing there pleading with him, saying:  "Come over to
Macedonia and help us!"
\anc act.16:09 A vision appeared to Paul during the night: A Macedonian man was standing there urging him,
"Come over to Macedonia and help us!" 
\ln 22.06
\bt So Paul and the others decided that God was leading them to go over to
Macedonia and tell the news about Jesus to there. So they immediately headed
there--and this time they knew they could preach! 
\anc act.16:10 After Paul saw the vision, we attempted immediately to go over to Macedonia, concluding that
God had called us to proclaim the good news to them.
\ln 22.07
\bt They arrived in the city of Philippi -- it was an important Roman colony in the
region.  And they stayed there for several days.
\anc act.16:12 and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of that district of Macedonia, a Roman
colony. We stayed in this city for some days. 
\ln 22.08
\bt Well, on Saturday Paul and the group went outside the city to the riverside
where they knew they would find some of their fellow Israelites--foreigners like
themselves--meeting for prayer.   They sat down and began talking to the
women who had gathered there.
\anc act.16:13 On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the side of the river, where we thought
there would be a place of prayer, and we sat down and began to speak to the women who had
assembled there. 
\ln 22.09
\bt One of the women was Lydia, she had a business in selling expensive purple
textiles.  And as she listened to Paul talking, God caused her to believe him.  
\anc act.16:14 A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, a God-fearing
woman, listened to us. The Lord opened her heart to respond to what Paul was saying. 
\ln 22.10 
\bt And so she had the ceremonial washing to show that she now belonged to the
group of believers, and so did her family members and others in her house.  And
she said to Paul and the others,  "If you consider me to be a believer of Jesus,
come and stay in my house."  And so they did.
\anc act.16:15 After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, "If you consider me to be a
believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house." And she persuaded us.

\ln 23.11
\bt Well, a few days passed, and once again Paul and the others were headed to the
place of prayer.  And on their way they passed a young slave girl. 
\anc ct.16:16 Now as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave girl met us
\ln 23.12
\bt And she turned and began following along behind them shouting "These men are
servants of the Most High God, who are telling you how to be saved."... "These
men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you how to be saved."

High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation." 
\ln 23.13
\bt The girl was a foretune-teller -- she had a spiritual power for telling the future,
and she made a lot of money for her owners.
\anc act.16:16 ... a slave girl met us who had a spirit that enabled her to foretell the future by supernatural
means. She brought her owners a great profit by fortune-telling. 
\ln 23.14
\bt She kept following Paul and the others every day shouting this same thing, until
Paul finally got really annoyed, and turned around and said to the spirit that was
controlling her:  "I command you, by the authority of Jesus, the Promised King,
that you come out of her."  And right then it left her.
\anc act.16:18 She continued to do this for many days. But Paul became greatly annoyed, and turned and
said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" And it came out of
her at once. 
\ln 23.15
\bt When the slave-owners realized that the girl no longer had this power to tell the
future, and that their profits and fortune were now gone, they grabbed Paul and
Silas and hauled them off to the authorities.
\anc act.16:19 But when her owners saw their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and
dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities. 
\ln 23.16 
\bt "The whole city is in an uproar because of these men!
\anc act.16:20 When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, "These men are throwing our
city into confusion. They are Jews 
\ln 23.17
\bt They are teaching the people to do things that are against our Roman customs." 
\anc act.16:21 and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us to accept or practice, since we are
Romans."
\ln 23.18
\bt A mob quickly formed against Paul and Silas, and the city officials ordered them
stripped and beaten with wooden rods. 
\anc act.16:22 The crowd joined the attack against them, and the magistrates tore the clothes off Paul and
Silas and ordered them to be beaten with rods. 
\ln 23.19
\bt They were severely beaten, and then they were thrown into prison. The jailer was
ordered to make sure they didn't escape. 
\anc act.16:23 After they had beaten them severely, they threw them into prison and commanded the jailer
to guard them securely. 
\ln 23.20 
\bt So he took no chances but put them into the inner dungeon and clamped their feet
in the stocks. 
\anc act.16:24 Receiving such orders, he threw them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
\ln 23.21
\bt Around midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing praise songs to God, and
the other prisoners were listening. 
\anc act.16:25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the rest of the
prisoners were listening to them. 
\ln 23.22
\bt Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, and the prison was shaken to its
foundations. All the doors flew open, and the chains of every prisoner fell off! 
\anc act.16:26 Suddenly a great earthquake occurred, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken.
Immediately all the doors flew open, and the bonds of all the prisoners came loose. 
\ln 23.23 
\bt The jailer woke up to see the prison doors wide open. He assumed the prisoners
had escaped, so he drew his sword to kill himself. 
\anc act.16:27 When the jailer woke up and saw the doors of the prison standing open, he drew his sword
and was about to kill himself, because he assumed the prisoners had escaped. 
\ln 23.24 
\bt But Paul shouted to him, "Don't do it! We are all here!" 
\anc act.16:28 But Paul called out loudly, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!" 
\ln 23.25 
\bt Trembling with fear, the jailer called for lights and ran to the dungeon and fell
down before Paul and Silas. 
\anc act.16:29 Calling for lights, the jailer rushed in and fell down trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas. 
\ln 23.26
\bt He brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what do I need to do to be saved?" 
\anc act.16:30 Then he brought them outside and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" 
\ln 23.27
\bt They answered, "Believe on Jesus, accept him as the one in control in your life,
and you will be saved, along with your entire household." 
\anc act.16:31 They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household." 
\ln 23.28
\bt Then they talked about Jesus with him and all who lived in his household. 
\anc act.16:32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him, along with all those who were in his house. 
\ln 23.29
\bt Then the jailer washed their wounds, and he and everyone in his household were
immediately given the ceremonial washing.

were baptized right away.

go!"

\bt So Paul and Silas returned to the home of Lydia, where they met with the believers
and encouraged them once more before leaving town.

\bt Now Paul and Silas and some others left Philippi, and they travelled around the
country until they came to a city by the name of Thessalonica. Now in that city
there was an actual place of worship for the expatriate Isralite community, and
they met there each weekend. 
\anc Act.17:01  After they traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where
there was a Jewish synagogue.

\bt As was Paul's custom, he joined them for three weekends in a row, and was
explaining things to them from their Holy Book.

addressed them from the scriptures,

fact that he would suffer and be killed, but that he would rise again from the

"This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ."

\bt Some who listened were listening to Paul were persuaded by his words and
became believers followed along with Paul and Silas--both men and women, 
many that were the local citizens, not part of the expatriate Israelite
community.
\anc Act.17:04  Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large group of
God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.

\bt However, the Israelite leaders became very ealous, and they went out into the
streets and formed a mob and started a riot! They went to the house of Jason,
where Paul & Silas were staying.  
\anc Act.17:05  But the Jews became jealous, and gathering together some worthless men from the rabble in
the marketplace, they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason's house, trying
to find Paul and Silas to bring them out to the assembly.
\ln 24.06
\bt But Paul and Silas weren't there.  But the mob grabbed Jason and some of the

shouted: "Paul and Silas have turned the rest of the world upside down, and now
they are here in our city, agitating!”

\ln 25.01
\bt After they had been gone from Thessalonica a while, Paul and Silas began to be
concerned about the believers there. They wanted to go back and visit them, but
something prevented them.
\anc 1Th.02:17  But when we were separated from you, brothers and sisters, for a short time (in presence,
not in affection) we became all the more fervent in our great desire to see you in person.
\anc 1Th.02:18  For we wanted to come to you (I, Paul, in fact tried again and again) but Satan thwarted
us.
\ln 25.02
\bt So they sent their young friend Timothy to visit them, and encourage them in
their faith. 
\anc 1Th.03:02  We sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, to
strengthen you and encourage you about your faith,
\ln 25.03
\bt When Timothy got back, he reported to Paul and Silas. He said, "It's good news!
"Their faith and love are as strong as ever!" 
\anc 1Th.03:06  But now Timothy has come to us from you and given us the good news of your faith and
love...
\ln 25.04
\bt But there was something else they wanted to teach the believers in
Thessalonica. So the three of them decided to write them a letter. Here's some
of what the letter said:
\anc 1Th.01:01  From Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians...
\ln 25.12
\bt Dear friends, we want you to know the wonderful truth about what happens to
believers when they die.  
\anc 1Th.04:13  Now we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who are asleep,
so that you will not grieve like the rest who have no hope.
\ln 25.17
\bt We know that Jesus died and came back to life, and so we also know that when
Jesus returns to earth, God will cause all those believers in Jesus who have died to
come to be with Jesus. 
\anc 1Th.04:14  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring with
him those who have fallen asleep as Christians. 
\ln 25.18
\bt For Jesus himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, the trumpet
call of God, and those who have died believing in Christ will rise from the dead. 
\anc 1Th.04:16  For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of
the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
\ln 25.19
\bt After that, those who are still alive will be caught up together with them in the
clouds to meet Jesus in the air. And so we will be with him forever!
\anc 1Th.04:17  Then we who are alive, who are left, will be suddenly caught up together with them in the
clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord. 
\ln 25.20
\bt Remind each of other of this wonderful promise!
\anc 1Th.04:18  Therefore encourage one another with these words.
